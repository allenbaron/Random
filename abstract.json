BACKGROUND: Interventions to reduce and prevent overweight, obesity and T2D has
been advocated worldwide. In Norway, Healthy Life Centres have been established
to help individuals to reduce and prevent diseases, offering physical activity
and dietary advice to establish healthy habits. Previous life experiences, social
support and help from health personnel could play a role in the process of
establishing healthy habits. The aim of this study was to explore how two groups 
of Healthy Life Centre participants described their previous life experiences,
social relations and wish for support from Healthy Life Centre personnel.
METHODS: A qualitative design was used, including 49 individual semi-structured
interviews. The interviews for this study were performed in two different
samples, one sample of participants applying for HLC participation in 2013
(n = 23) and one sample of participants invited to HLC participation in 2015
(n = 26). The data was analyzed using systematic text condensation.
RESULTS: Three main themes in a chronological (past, present and future) order
were identified: 1. Previous life experiences stamping life situation (past
time). 2. Social relations being a support or a burden in everyday life (present 
time) and 3. Expressing wishes for HLC support (future).
CONCLUSIONS: In the process of establishing healthy habits, the need for help
from personnel may be differentiated based on previous life experiences and
present social relations.

OBJECTIVES: Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neuropsychiatric disease
characterized by involuntary movements and behavioural symptoms. This study aimed
to explore the association between the level of Sense of Coherence (SOC) and
health problems, and psychological distress factors in partners to HD affected
persons and their need of support.
MATERIALS & METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational design was
used. Data was generated from 94 HD partners from almost all networks, outpatient
clinics and nursing homes specialized in HD across Sweden. HD partners filled out
questionnaires with scales measuring SOC, health problems, psychological distress
factors and the Total Functional Capacity Scale (TFC). Non-parametric analysis
was used to analyse group differences.
RESULTS: Huntington's disease partners with a lower level of SOC experienced more
health problems than those with a higher level. Health problems among HD partners
were most common among HD affected in TFC stage 3, indicating that the partners
need most support during this period. Lower level of SOC was associated with
loneliness in the relationship; less possibilities to socialize with friends;
worries about the future as well as being subjected to physical aggression. The
experience of physical aggression from the HD affected person was common (44.7%) 
and 28.6% of the partners expressed worries about being subjected to physical
aggression.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that knowledge about the partners' SOC score may
be a helpful indicator identifying HD partners who are more vulnerable and need
additional help caring for the person with HD and can be a complementary tool in 
assessment protocols.

Early-on in the COVID-19 pandemic when universities were closed as part of the
nation-wide public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, studying and student
life significantly changed. Based on limited evidence the aim of this study was
to explore the relationship between sense of coherence (SoC), future worries and 
mental health outcomes among German university students during the early phase of
the pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey with n = 14 916 participants was
carried out by inviting all private and public universities in Germany. All data 
were analysed using univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistics. Findings
indicate a low and very low wellbeing for 38% of university students. Moreover,
29% reported being affected by at least two health complaints more than once
week. Both health outcomes follow a social gradient and could be more frequently 
observed for respondents with lower subjective social status and female students.
Regression analysis revealed significant association between the SoC dimensions
and wellbeing (OR: 1.2-2.03) as well as health complaints (OR: 1.58-1.71). A high
level of future worries was associated with low/very low wellbeing (OR: 2.83) and
multiple health complaints (OR: 2.84). Based on the results, the public health
response to the pandemic and university health promotion should therefore
consider student mental health as an important target within their policy and
action frameworks.

The researcher reports the impact of online yoga lessons on a cohort of
community-dwelling older adult women in mitigating fears, anxieties and promoting
resilience, wellbeing and salutogenic wellness during the pandemic as compared to
a control group. Online yoga lessons were effective and economic class,
education, religion, marital status, and living arrangements were significant
moderators. Intervention adherence had the strongest predictor effects. The
combined effects of significant predictors were robust and latent class analyses 
indicated middle class, above threshold (>50%) lessons attendees and
self-practice doers, single, living in nonstandard families, college educated,
and Hindus, were likely to gain most.

We deal with the problem of characterizing a source or scatterer from
electromagnetic radiated or scattered field measurements. The problem refers to
the amplitude and phase measurements which has applications also to
interferometric approaches at optical frequencies. From low frequencies
(microwaves) to high frequencies or optics, application examples are
near-field/far-field transformations, object restoration from measurements within
a pupil, near-field THz imaging, optical coherence tomography and ptychography.
When analyzing the transmitting-sensing system, we can define "optimal virtual"
sensors by using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) approach which has been, 
since long time, recognized as the "optimal" tool to manage linear algebraic
problems. The problem however emerges of discretizing the relevant singular
functions, thus defining the field sampling. To this end, we have recently
developed an approach based on the Singular Value Optimization (SVO) technique.
To make the "virtual" sensors physically realizable, in this paper, two
approaches are considered: casting the "virtual" field sensors into arrays
reaching the same performance of the "virtual" ones; operating a segmentation of 
the receiver. Concerning the array case, two ways are followed: synthesize the
array by a generalized Gaussian quadrature discretizing the linear reception
functionals and use elementary sensors according to SVO. We show that SVO is
"optimal" in the sense that it leads to the use of elementary, non-uniformly
located field sensors having the same performance of the "virtual" sensors and
that generalized Gaussian quadrature has essentially the same performance.

There is limited empirical data about both health and end-of-life (EoL) issues
among the Indigenous Sámi of Fennoscandia. We therefore aimed to investigate
experiences of EoL care and support among the Sámi, both from the Sámi community 
itself as well as from more formalized health and social care services in Sweden.
Our primary data source is from focus group discussions (FGDs) held at a Sámi
event in 2017 with 24 people, complemented with analysis of previously collected 
data from 15 individual interviews with both Sámi and non-Sámi informants
familiar with dying, death and bereavement among Sámi; "go-along" discussions
with 12 Sámi, and individual interviews with 31 Sámi about advance care planning.
After initial framework analysis, we applied a salutogenic model for
interpretation, focusing on a sense of community coherence. We found a range of
generalized resistance resources in relation to the Sámi community, which
appeared to support EoL care situations, i.e., Social Organization; Familiarity
with EoL Care, Collective Cultural Heritage; Expressions of Spirituality; Support
from Majority Care Systems; and Brokerage. These positive features appear to
support key components of a sense of community coherence, i.e.,
comprehensibility, meaningfulness and manageability. We also found relatively
few, but notable deficits that may diminish the sense of community coherence,
i.e., lack of communication in one's own language; orientation, familiarity
and/or agreement in contacts with formal health and social care systems; and/or
support from extended family. The results suggest that there is a robust basis
among Sámi for well-functioning EoL care; a challenge is in developing supportive
interactions with the majority health and social care systems that support and
complement these structures, for partnership in developing care that is
meaningful, comprehensible and manageable even in potentially difficult EoL
situations.

BACKGROUND: Angioedema coexisting chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is proved
to result in patient anxiety occurrence, but the mechanisms and susceptibility
patterns are unknown. Sense of coherence (SOC) is one of methods of coping with
stress and is defined as a person's general orientation toward life. We decided
to assess SOC disturbances in CSU patients in the context of possible angioedema 
association.
METHODS: The study comprised 71 CSU subjects. To analyze disease activity, the
Urticaria Activity Score seven-day assessment questionnaire (UAS7) was used. For 
anxiety assessment, the STAI questionnaire was used. The SOC-29 questionnaire,
consisting of questions related to comprehensibility (SOC-C), manageability
(SOC-M), and meaningfulness (SOC-Mf), was used to analyze SOC parameters (SOC-T).
RESULTS: In patients with coexisting angioedema, we observed statistically
significantly lower values of SOC-Mf and SOC-T in comparison to the wheals only
group. In the angioedema group, we noticed significant negative correlations
between SOC-M and SOC-Mf, as well as SOC-T values and anxiety. In the wheals only
group, we proved statistically significant correlations between SOC-Mf and SOC-T 
and anxiety assessed as a state.
CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to identify CSU patients manifesting angioedema as
they are more likely to have impaired SOC. Lower SOC in this specific group of
patients can be related to anxiety symptoms occurrence and should probably be an 
indication for psychological support.

Learn, Have Fun and Be Healthy! An Interview Study of Swedish Teenagers' Views of
Participation in Club Sport.

In Sweden, participation in club sport is a vital part of many children's lives. 
Despite this, many stop in their teenage years, raising questions concerning if
and in what ways club sport can provide health-promoting activities via longer,
sustained participation. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to explore and 
discuss young people's views of club sport from a health-promoting perspective.
The analysis draws on three sets of qualitative data: results from focus groups
interviews conducted in 2007 (n = 14) and in 2016 (n = 8) as well as 18 in-depth 
interviews conducted 2008. Antonovsy's salutogenic theory and his sense of
coherence (SOC) model inspired the analysis. Teenagers want to be a part of club 
sport because of a sense of enjoyment, learning, belonging and feeling healthy.
Teenagers stop when sport becomes too serious, non-flexible, time-consuming and
too competitive. The urge for flexibility and possibilities to make individual
decisions were emphasised in 2016. The organisation of club sport, it seems, has 
not adapted to changes in society and a generation of teenagers' health
interests. Club sport has the potential to be a health-promoting arena, but the
focus should be on changing the club sport environment, instead of a focus on
changing young people.

Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a modality that uses
low-coherence interferometry to visualize and assess anterior segment ocular
features, offering several advantages of being a sterile and noncontact modality 
that generates high-resolution cross-sectional images of the tissues. The
qualitative and quantitative information provided by AS-OCT may be extremely
useful for the clinician in the assessment of a wide spectrum of corneal
infections, guiding in the management and follow-up of these patients. In
clinical practice, infections are routinely evaluated with slit-lamp
biomicroscopy, an examination and imaging modality that is limited by the
physical characteristics of light. As a consequence, the depth of pathology and
the eventually associated corneal edema cannot be accurately measured with the
slit-lamp. Therefore, it represents a limit for the clinician, as in vivo
information about corneal diseases and the response to treatment is limited.
Resolution of corneal infection is characterized by an early reduction in corneal
edema, followed by a later reduction in infiltration: both parameters can be
routinely measured with standardized serial images by AS-OCT.

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to perform a detailed longitudinal
phenotyping and genetic characterization of 32 Italian patients with a
nonsyndromic retinal dystrophy and mutations in the CEP290 gene.
Methods: We reviewed the clinical history and examinations of 32 patients with a 
nonsyndromic retinal dystrophy due to mutations in the CEP290 gene, followed up
(mean follow-up: 5.9 years) at 3 Italian centers. The clinical examinations
included: best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), optical coherence tomography
(OCT), and full-field electroretinogram (ERG).
Results: Patients (mean age = 19.0 ± 3.4 years) had a mean BCVA of 1.73 ± 0.20
logMAR. Longitudinal analysis of BCVA showed a nonsignificant decline. Central
retinal thickness (CRT) declined significantly with age at an exponential rate of
1.0%/year (P = 0.001). At disease onset, most patients (19/32; 49.4%) had
nystagmus. The absence of nystagmus was significantly associated with better BCVA
and more preserved CRT (P < 0.05). ERG showed undetectable responses in most
patients (64.0%), whereas reduced scotopic and photopic responses were observed
in four patients (16.0%) who had no nystagmus. We identified 35 different
variants, among which 12 were novel. Our genotype-phenotype correlation analysis 
shows a significantly worse BCVA in patients harboring a loss-of-function
mutation and the deep-intronic variant c.2991+1655A>G.
Conclusions: Our study highlights a mild phenotype of the disease, characterized 
by absence of nystagmus, good visual acuity, considerably preserved retinal
morphology, and recordable ERG, confirming the wide spectrum of CEP290-related
retinal dystrophies. Finally, in our cohort, the deep intronic variant
c.2991+1655A>G was associated with a more severe phenotype.

Background: Illness can provoke a crisis response that affects condition
acceptance, treatment and recovery. Patients' sense of coherence can influence
this explored across patient cohorts internationally. However, few studies
examine these effects in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. This study investigated
sense of coherence and social support of patients with hepatic cirrhosis.
Methods: The psychological status of 146 patients admitted to the Digestive
System Department, First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University,
Harbin, China from Mar 2016 to Mar 2019 with hepatic cirrhosis was assessed using
the Sense of Coherence (SOC-13), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) and crisis
assessment scales.
Results: There was a low level of crisis response in patients with hepatic
cirrhosis that was influenced by age, disease course, education level and
Child-Pugh grade and negatively correlated with sense of coherence and social
support.
Conclusion: Liver cirrhosis patients had a low level of crisis response. As the
level of crisis response in is correlated with patients' sense of coherence,
social support and educational level, careful assessment, tailored educational
interventions and mobilizing of family support are important to maximize
responses to illness and thus improve quality of life.

Repetition and Aesthetic Judgment in Post-tonal Music for Large Ensemble and
Orchestra.

Touizrar M(1), Knoll AL(2), Siedenburg K(2).

and Culture Studies, University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland.

Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany.

Post-tonal music often poses perceptual and cognitive challenges for listeners,
potentially related to the use of relatively uncommon and unfamiliar musical
material and compositional processes. As a basic compositional device, repetition
affects memory for music and is structured by composers in very different ways
across tonal and post-tonal musical repertoires. Of particular concern is whether
post-tonal music exhibits mnemonic affordances that allow listeners to experience
a sense of global coherence, and whether repetition correlates strongly with
aesthetic judgment. Although previous research suggests that repetition impacts
aesthetic preference, empirical research has not mapped out the relationship
between repetition and aesthetic judgments across a broad set of post-tonal
music. Presenting 14 excerpts, grouped into three categories: tonal, modernist,
and post-1970, we observed that indications of repetitions in the music for a
group of 60 listeners, with and without musical training, showed significant
periods of interindividual synchronization. Aesthetic judgments were assessed by 
means of ratings for the following parameters: familiarity with the piece,
confidence of repetition responses, judgments of affordances for easy listening, 
coherence, similarity of moments, and recognition, as well as listeners' liking
and interest. A principal component analysis (PCA) on the joint question data and
the repetition responses suggested that two factors account for 92% of variance
in the data. These factors were interpreted as dominated by aesthetic judgment
and repetition strength. Linear mixed-effects regression indicated that
repetition strength generally differed across excerpt category, with modernist
excerpts featuring lower repetition strength compared to both post-1970 and tonal
excerpts. Aesthetic preference, on the other hand, was lower for excerpts in both
the modernist and post-1970 categories when compared to tonal excerpts. The
analysis did not reveal difference in response behavior for repetition responses 
as a function of musical training, though it indicated higher preference of
modernist excerpts with increasing levels of musical training. Overall, the
results suggest that the two factors, aesthetic judgment and repetition strength,
act as independent determinants in the experience of post-tonal music.

Less than 50% of patients with diabetes achieve the glycaemic goals recommended
by the American Diabetes Association. The set of factors associated with
adherence to treatment is very broad. Evidence suggests that psychosocial factors
are related to medication adherence of patients with type 2 diabetes. Due to the 
lack of a clear statement from researchers regarding the relationship of
psychosocial factors to adherence, an electronic search was conducted in PubMed, 
MEDLINE, Academic Search Ultimate, CINAHL Complete, Edition and Health Source:
Nursing/Academic Edition using the following keywords "adherence", "diabetes",
"social support", "stress", "anxiety and depression", "beliefs about medicine",
"communication", "older age", "frailty", "cognitive impairment", "addiction",
"acceptance of illness", "sense of coherence" obtaining 2758 results. After a
narrowing of searches and reference scanning, 36 studies were qualified. The
studies analysed showed negative effects of anxiety, diabetes distress, older
age, poor communication with physicians, stress, concerns about medicines and
cognitive impairment on levels of self-care and medication adherence. One study
did not confirm the association of depression with adherence. Self-efficacy,
social and family support, and acceptance of illness had a beneficial effect on
medication adherence. In conclusion, the current evidence suggests that the
relationship between psychosocial factors and adherence has reliable scientific
support.

long-term care towards sex and intimacy among older adults, specifically the
extent to which they conceptualise sex and intimacy as a need, a right, a
privilege or as a component of overall well-being.
METHODS: The present study was a part of a two-arm mixed-methods cross-sectional 
study using a concurrent triangulation design. A validated survey tool was
developed; 433 staff surveys were collected from 35 facilities across the
country. Interviews were conducted with 75 staff, residents and family members.
RESULTS: It was common for staff, residents and family members to talk about
intimacy and sexuality in terms of rights and needs. As well as using the
language of needs and rights, it was common for participants to use terms related
to well-being, such as fun, happiness or being miserable. One participant in
particular (a staff member) described receiving intimate touch as a 'kind of
care'-a particularly useful way of framing the conversation.
CONCLUSION: While staff, residents and family frequently used the familiar
language of needs and rights to discuss access to intimate touch, they also used 
the language of well-being and care. Reframing the conversation in this way
serves a useful purpose: it shifts the focus from simply meeting minimum
obligations to a salutogenic approach-one that focuses on caring for the whole
person in order to improve overall well-being and quality of life.

BACKGROUND: The nursing profession is associated with constant presence of
difficult situations and stress, which arise from responsibility for the highest 
values - human life and health. With demographic changes in the society, the
demand for nursing care increases. Looking after the health of nursing staff
becomes a non-material investment in employees. One of the most important health 
potentials described in literature is the sense of coherence. It can
significantly contribute to maintaining good health, modify one's functioning in 
a stressful working environment and influence the choice of strategies for coping
with stress.
AIM: The aim of the study was to describe the specific relationship between the
sense of coherence and strategies for coping with stress in a group of
professionally active nurses.
METHODOLOGY AND METHODS: The study involved 91 nurses in central Poland, aged
22-52. The group was diversified in terms of: education, work system, marital
status and place of residence. The study was conducted with the use of: Sense of 
Coherence Questionnaire SOC-29 and Inventory to Measure Coping Strategies with
Stress - Mini-COPE. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of 
scientific research set out in the Helsinki Declaration.
RESULTS: The sense of coherence value in the test group was M = 134.24
(SD = 19.55). In stressful situations nurses most often used active strategies to
cope with stress: Planning M = 2.10 (SD = 0.54), Seeking Emotional Social Support
M = 1.95 (SD = 0.68) and Seeking Instrumental Social Support M = 1.95
(SD = 0.69), and the least frequently: Alcohol/Drug Use M = 0.28 (SD = 0.48). The
level of the sense of coherence and its components differentiated the strategies 
of coping with stress used in the examined group of nurses.
CONCLUSIONS: The research confirmed that the sense of coherence serves as a
health potential in a stressful working environment - a high sense of coherence
translate into better mental health, correct functioning in the working
environment, and using adaptive strategies of coping with stress. Nurses with a
stronger sense of coherence used more adaptive strategies to deal with stress
than those with average or low levels.

Functional pain disorders are frequent and represent a significant burden in
primary care consultations. Scientific advances in neuroscience allow us to
understand these syndromes from the perspective of perceptual, vegetative,
affective and cognitive dysfunction. Simple tools can be useful in the history
and clinical examination, looking specifically for positive signs in favor of a
functional pain disorder. It is important to maintain a primary care management, 
following some principles summarized in expert recommendations. Building a solid 
trust relationship, a salutogenesis approach and medical and therapeutic
deceleration («choose wisely») are to be favored.

Publisher: Les troubles douloureux fonctionnels sont fréquents et représentent
une charge importante dans les consultations de premier recours. Les avancées

Few studies examine the relationship of grief with interrelated and broad
concepts. In this study, the role of sense of coherence and emotion regulation
difficulties in the relationship between early maladaptive schemas and grief was 
investigated with individuals (N = 254) who have lost a close person in the last 
5 years. Mediation and moderated mediation analyses revealed that individuals
with early maladaptive schemas may experience more complicated grief symptoms
through the effect of early maladaptive schemas. For individuals with
self-sacrifice schema, difficulties in the grief process were regulated by
moderate to high levels of sense of coherence.

The birthing room is a major workplace for midwives but how it influences them in
practice is not enough investigated.Purpose: This study aimed to explore
midwives´ experiences of how the birthing room affects them in their work to
promote a normal physiological birth.Methods: A phenomenological reflective
lifeworld research approach was used and included individual interviews with 15
midwives working at four different hospitals in western Sweden, and of which two 
also assisted at homebirths. The analysis focused on the meanings of the study
phenomenon.Results: A birthing room can by its design either support a normal
physiological birth or support a risk approach to childbirth. Four opposing
constituents complete the essential meaning of the birthing rooms, and to which
the midwives need to relate in their roles as guardians for normal birth: i) a
private or a public room; ii) a home-like or hospital-like room; iii) a room
promoting activity or passivity; iv) a room promoting the midwife´s presence or
absence.Conclusions: The birthing room mirrors a pathogenic-oriented care
approach. A presupposition for the work to keep the birth bubble intact is to
protect the mother from disturbing elements both inside and outside the room.

Burnout, satisfaction and happiness among German general practitioners (GPs): A
cross-sectional survey on health resources and stressors.

School of Medicine, Witten/Herdecke University, Witten, Germany.

Well-being is a major issue among health care professionals, especially
physicians. Less job satisfaction and impaired health can have an impact on
health care quality. Our aim was to examine the association of stressors
(illegitimate tasks) and health related resources (work-related sense of
coherence; recovery experience) with life satisfaction, happiness, job
satisfaction and burnout among German general practitioners (GPs). We conducted a
cross-sectional survey among general medical practices in Germany. Main outcome
measures were life satisfaction, happiness (Subjective Happiness Scale), job
satisfaction (Work Satisfaction Scale) and burnout (Copenhagen Burnout
Inventory). 548 GPs from across Germany participated (53.6% males, 45.6% females;
mostly representative of German GPs). One third (35.2%) of the participants
reported a high prevalence of personal, and one quarter (26.5%) indicated a high 
prevalence of work-related burnout symptoms. Illegitimate tasks are negatively
associated with life and job satisfaction and are positively associated with
personal, work-related and patient-related burnout among GPs. Work-SoC and
recovery experience are positively associated with life satisfaction, happiness, 
and job satisfaction and are negatively associated with personal, work-related
and patient-related burnout. Female physicians have a higher job satisfaction
than male physicians. Being female and working as an employed physician is
associated with a higher prevalence of personal burnout symptoms. GPs working in 
a group practice are happier and more satisfied with their job than GPs in single
practices. Personal, work-related and patient-related burnout symptoms are
stronger in GPs working in a single practice than in GPs in group practices. Our 
results highlight that Work-SoC, recovery experience and illegitimate tasks are
important for creating work-related well-being among GPs. Introducing health
promotion activities which aim to strengthen recovery experience and Work-SoC, as
well as interventions to restructure tasks, may increase life satisfaction,
happiness, and job satisfaction and reduce burnout symptoms in this health care
profession.

Impact of sense of coherence, resilience and loneliness on quality of life
amongst older adults in long-term care: A correlational study using the
salutogenic model.

AIMS: This study aimed to identify the predicting factors of quality of life
(QoL) from a set of psychosocial, sociodemographic and clinical variables amongst
older adults in a long-term care setting.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional, descriptive correlational study.
METHOD: The study was conducted in a nursing home and a day care centre from July
to December 2019. Two hundred older adults were recruited. Guided by the
salutogenic model, the sense of coherence (SOC) scale, Connor-Davidson resilience
scale, de Jong Gierveld loneliness scale and World Health Organization quality of
life instrument-older adults (WHOQOL-OLD) were used. The sociodemographic and
clinical profiles of participants were collected. Descriptive statistics, Pearson
product-moment correlation coefficient, independent-samples t test, one-way
analysis of variance and stepwise regression were utilised in the analysis.
RESULTS: The mean score for WHOQOL-OLD was 94.42 ± 19.55. The highest mean score 
was observed in the "Death and Dying" facet, while the lowest mean scores were
reflected in the "Autonomy" and "Intimacy" facets of QoL. Regardless of resident 
type, most QoL scores were similar across different variables. Based on the
stepwise regression, higher manageability and meaningfulness in SOC, higher
resilience, lower social loneliness, lower emotional loneliness and hearing
impairments are significantly associated with higher QoL.
CONCLUSION: Manageability, meaningfulness and resilience should be enhanced while
ameliorating feelings of loneliness to improve the QoL amongst older adults
receiving long-term care. Age, marital status, educational level, care
arrangement, body mass index, performance in activities of daily living,
comorbidities and hearing and mobility impairments could influence QoL and thus
warrant more attention.
IMPACT: Future interventions can be conducted in group sessions to facilitate
social interaction and alleviate loneliness. More resources should be allocated
to enhance older adults' care arrangements and coping mechanisms to provide them 
with the support, as they face challenges in daily life due to mobility
impairment and other restrictions.

Physical activity (PA) contributes to health throughout life. In particular,
young people can benefit from this. Schools can play a key role in providing
learning conditions to experience meaningful PAs aimed at inspiring students to
lifelong PA. In this article, we argue the need for a salutogenic approach in
schools focussing on respecting and enhancing adolescents' agency with regard to 
their PA. This approach entails listening to adolescents' perspectives and
inviting them to participate in actively designing and carrying out PA as a
prerequisite for their inclusive engagement. We unpack the concept of agency by
drawing on insights from the Capability Approach. This provides input for the
integration of agency in health promoting schools and salutogenic approaches, to 
enhance PA-related agency. Finally, we outline a research agenda to, eventually, 
create opportunities for students in schools to expand their PA-related agency.
Lay Summary Physical activity (PA) contributes to health throughout life. Schools
can play a key role in fostering meaningful PA experiences to inspire students to
lifelong PA. This requires schools to focus on students' personal aspirations,
providing them with the space to develop their autonomy and find opportunities to
decide and act upon expanding their agency with respect to the physically active 
lifestyles they deem meaningful.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the psychological well-being of healthcare
professionals, among them, on medical and nursing occupational specialists. This 
study describes the psychological distress that this group has suffered,
analyzing the effect that the sense of coherence related with the history of
contact with infected people has generated in their mental health.
Cross-sectional descriptive study using online questionnaires. Data were
collected on a sample of 499 subjects, representing 42.0% and 38.8% of the
associations of specialists in Occupational Medicine and Nursing, respectively. A
univariate data analysis, independence test, and the CHAID multivariate method
were carried out. The percentage of workers with high psychological distress was 
higher among women than among men; this was also higher in public sector workers 
than in the private sector. No differences have been observed regarding
psychological distress and educational level, coexistence, having children,
working away from home, having a pet, or between being a physician or nurse. The 
most efficient measure to prevent psychological distress was acting regarding the
comprehensibility dimension of the sense of coherence. Sex, contact with any
infected person, age, living as a couple, working in public or private centers,
the availability of diagnostic tests, and the correlation with the manageability 
dimension were modulating factors. Sense of coherence is an effective measure to 
prevent psychological distress due to contact with people affected by COVID-19 in
Occupational Health professionals.

Imbalanced nutrition is associated with accelerated ageing, possibly mediated by 
microbiota. An analysis of the circulatory microbiota obtained from the
leukocytes of participants in the MRC Twenty-07 general population cohort was
performed. We now report that in this cohort, the most biologically aged exhibit 
a significantly higher abundance of circulatory pathogenic bacteria, including
Neisseria, Rothia and Porphyromonas, while those less biologically aged possess
more circulatory salutogenic (defined as being supportive of human health and
wellbeing) bacteria, including Lactobacillus, Lachnospiraceae UCG-004 and
Kocuria. The presence of these salutogenic bactreria is consistent with a
capacity to metabolise and produce Nrf2 agonists. We also demonstrate that
associated one carbon metabolism, notably betaine levels, did not vary with
chronological age, but displayed a difference with socioeconomic position (SEP). 
Those at lower SEP possessed significantly lower betaine levels indicative of a
poorer diet and poorer health span and consistent with reduced global DNA
methylation levels in this group. Our data suggest a clear route to improving age
related health and resilience based on dietary modulation of the microbiota.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in changes in almost every aspect 
of life. The fatal consequences of the pandemic have been clearly reported, with 
direct and indirect effects; however, there is some evidence of a positive
secondary impact, such as fewer motor accidents, lower influenza burden and
reduced air pollution.
METHODS/MODEL: We present a model to describe the differing effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic on mortality, taking into account external pressures and
internal resources and their relationship with resilience and health behaviors,
which affect mortality risk, inspired by elements of the salutogenic model.
Individuals with lower resources and from more deprived communities are likely to
be more negatively affected by the external changes occurring, while those with
more resources may be more likely to experience the benefits. Both individual and
community resources affect coping and influence both mental and physical health.
CONCLUSIONS: Decision makers should consider ways to incorporate the positive
changes which occurred as part of the exit strategy. Societies should invest in
building resources to improve both individual and community resilience to help
people be better prepared and more able to cope and adapt in times of crisis.
Special emphasis should be given to weaker populations most affected by external 
changes, including older people, low socioeconomic groups, those with mental
health issues and minority groups, in order to reduce disparities.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to distinguish independent and shared
effects of material/structural factors and psychosocial resources in explaining
educational inequalities in self-rated health (SRH) by using structural equation 
modelling.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.
METHODS: Data were derived from a questionnaire sent to a random sample of the
population in five counties in Sweden in 2008. The study population (aged 25-75
years) included 15,099 men and 17,883 women. Exploratory structural equation
modelling was used to analyse the pathways from educational level to SRH.
RESULTS: The pathway including both material/structural factors (e.g. financial
buffer and unemployment) and psychosocial resources (e.g. sense of coherence and 
social participation) explained about 40% of educational differences in SRH for
both men and women. The pathways including only the independent effects of
psychosocial resources (14% in men and 20% in women) or material/structural
factors (9% and 18%, respectively) explained substantial but smaller proportions 
of the differences.
CONCLUSIONS: The major pathway explaining educational inequalities in SRH
included both material/structural factors and psychosocial resources. Therefore, 
to reduce educational inequalities in SRH, interventions need to address both
material/structural conditions and psychosocial resources across educational
groups.

Purpose: To explore how people with mental illness experience recovery in the
Clubhouse context, and which ingredients of the model they find active in
promoting recovery.Methods: Hermeneutic-phenomenological design. Individual,
semi-structured interviews with 18 Norwegian Clubhouse members. Systematic text
condensation was used in analysis.Results: Three main themes emerged: "Balancing 
unlimited support with meeting challenges", with two sub-themes: "Unlimited
membership: space for self-agency or hindering development?" and "Becoming a
Clubhouse member: concerns and positive experiences". The second main theme was: 
"Learning how to build new skills and roles in the community". The third main
theme was: "Getting better through and for work", with two sub-themes: "Work at
the Clubhouse as a means to recovery" and "Preparing for a working life in
society". Overall, participants experienced improved mental and social wellbeing 
and work readiness.Conclusions: Recovery in the Clubhouse context requires
members' personal initiative, thus people having poor mental health might
struggle with utilizing the Clubhouse. However, participants reported that lack
of challenges within the community thwarted their recovery. Based on
Salutogenesis, conscious application of challenge in Clubhouse activities might
enhance members' recovery. Furthermore, participants' all-round involvement in
their recovery journeys suggests the importance of shared decision-making in
recovery-oriented services.

AIMS: To critically appraise the evidence of the impact of exposure to
salutogenic green environment on mortality, which is an important endpoint in
epidemiological and clinical studies.
METHODS: We searched for studies published and indexed in three databases
(PubMed, AMED, and CINAHL Plus) from inception until 31 March 2020, complemented 
with a search of cited literature for articles describing the effects of
greenness on mortality in Asia-Pacific region. Eligible articles were screened
and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. A random-effects model
was utilised to obtain pool hazard ratio (HR) and risk ratio of all-cause
mortality outcome.
RESULTS: The search identified 3239 studies, of which 20 studies reporting
133,363 participants from longitudinal cohort studies and 202 million people from
population-based prevalence studies were included in the review. The majority of 
the studies (60%) were conducted in high-income countries in Asia-Pacific. All
participants of the longitudinal cohort studies were aged 60 years or older,
whereas the prevalence studies involved people of all age groups. A significant
protective association of green environment exposure with all-cause mortality was
reported in 18 studies. Pooled results from five studies showed increased level
of greenness exposure was associated with a significant decrease in all-cause
mortality (pooled HR = 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.93 to 1.02;
p < 0.01; I²= 87.8%). Meta-analysis of total number of deaths in different
quartiles of green spaces noted decreased risks of mortality with all causes of
death with increased surrounding greenness.
CONCLUSIONS: Some limited evidence suggests that populations exposed to the
greener environment have a lower risk of mortality, implying the potential role
of greenness in increasing longevity. Further studies with standardised design
and outcome reporting should be conducted in low- and middle-income countries and
in populations of low socioeconomic status to glean more generalisable and
complete evidence for public health policy implications.

Child and family health nurses (CFHNs) work in a variety of settings with
families to promote optimal growth and development in infants and children from
birth to 5 years. Literature is available about models of care that CFHNs use in 
their work, but there is limited information about how CFHNs enact care
specifically for infants and children. The aim of this scoping review was to
identify and contextualize existing knowledge of how CFHNs, both in Australia and
internationally, care for infants and children. Arksey and O'Malley's (2005)
framework was used to review 27 studies from Australia, Sweden, Finland, United
Kingdom (UK), United States of America (USA), Ireland, Netherlands, Denmark and
Canada. It was identified that CFHNs, equipped with a range of assessment tools
for early intervention and health promotion, use a partnership approach when
working with parents to promote the health and well-being of infants and
children. The literature revealed the complexity of the roles undertaken by CFHNs
when caring for infants and children. Review findings indicated that CFHNs' work 
is distinctive because it is conducted in home and community settings, is
relational and salutogenic in nature and is also located in the domain of
preventative health and early intervention.

University, Kayseri, Turkey.

AIMS: This research is conducted to determine the effect of salutogenesis-based
home care on the sense of coherence in patients with peritoneal dialysis.
BACKGROUND: Recent studies on the salutogenesis model have shown that the model
is effective in promoting and improving health. It was observed that studies
based on the salutogenesis model were carried out in the form of a training
programme, and there was no study that shows its effectiveness on patient care by
integrating it into the nursing process.
DESIGN: The research is conducted as a pre-test-post-test control group
experimental study.
METHODS: The study included 73 patients, including 36 in the intervention group
and 37 in the control group. The research data are collected using the Patient
Identifier Information Form, Dialysis Symptom Index (DSI), General Self-Efficacy 
Scale (GSES) and the Sense of Coherence Scale (SIS). The intervention group is
provided care based on the salutogenesis model by making home visits 1 time per
week for 8 weeks. In this study, the TREND checklist was followed for
non-randomised controlled trials.
RESULTS: In the study, the pre-test DSI, GSES and SIS (meaningfulness,
comprehensibility, manageability sub-dimension) mean scores of the individuals in
the intervention and control groups are similar. The third-month and sixth-month 
intervention group SIS total and sub-dimension scores and GSES scores are found
to be statistically significantly higher than the scores of the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the study, it is determined that the care based on
the salutogenesis model provided to peritoneal dialysis patients increases the
sense of coherence and self-efficacy and provides symptom control and decreases
the dialysis symptoms.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It has been observed that the salutogenesis model
can be used as a step of nursing care in providing symptom control by
strengthening the self-efficacy of patients in clinical and home care.

PURPOSE: To assess self-perceived health and sense of coherence (SOC) in
adolescents with spina bifida (SB) in the West Bank, Palestine, compared to a
healthy reference group. Further, to assess the association between impairment
levels in the adolescents with SB and their self-perceived health and SOC.
METHODS: Fifty adolescents with SB and 150 healthy adolescents completed measures
of self-perceived health - the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQLTM 4.0)
- and SOC. The rehabilitation center nurses identified the physical impairments
of the adolescents with SB from their medical records, and classified them by
impairment severity.
RESULTS: Adolescents with SB reported lower self-perceived health (PedsQL median 
55, IQR 42-67), than the reference group (median 85, IQR 74-90), p < 0.001, and
lower SOC (median 47, IQR 44-50) than the reference group (median 55, IQR 44-61),
p < 0.001. Impairment level was inversely associated with both self-perceived
health and SOC.
CONCLUSIONS: The low self-perceived health and SOC among adolescents with SB in
Palestine indicate the need for collaboration between policy makers and providers
to improve these adolescents' physical and social environment and to promote the 
rehabilitation services provided for them.Implications for rehabilitationThe low 
self-perceived health and SOC among adolescents with SB in Palestine highlight
the need to develop appropriate interventions to promote their health,
independency, and self-care management.Collaboration of the caregivers and health
care providers is required to develop, implement, and evaluate intervention
programs that might promote coping abilities of the adolescents with SB.A
multidisciplinary approach is needed to set goals that have a meaningful impact
on social, emotional, behavioral, and educational conditions of the adolescents
with SB and in different settings, for example, home, school, and community.The
environment in Palestine presents barriers to the social engagement of
adolescents with SB, and new ways are needed to enhance their participation in
the society to promote their self-concept and wellbeing.

ABSTRACT: There is a need to comprehensively identify depression-related factors,
including individual and socioeconomic factors, in each country or cultural area,
to consider effective measures to address depression within communities. However,
there are not enough studies on middle-aged residents in Japan or other Eastern
countries to currently achieve this. Thus, the aim of this study was to
comprehensively identify factors related to depression in middle-aged residents
in Japan, an Eastern country.The study design was cross-sectional. A
questionnaire survey was conducted among all community residents aged 40 to 59 in
a rural municipality in Western Japan. The questionnaire contained items on
demographic characteristics, psychological factors, health-related behaviors, and
socioeconomic factors. A Chi-Squared test or Fisher exact test was used to
analyze the relationships between depression and each assessed factor. Next, a
logistic regression analysis was performed to identify comprehensive
relationships between depression and its related factors.Data from 362
participants were analyzed. The average age was 51.5 years; 148 were male. A
Chi-Squared test or Fisher exact test demonstrated that many psychological
factors, health-related behaviors, and socioeconomic factors ware significantly
related to depression. A logistic regression analysis showed that depression was 
significantly associated with male gender, low sense of coherence, high cognitive
stress levels, low help-seeking behavior, poor quality sleep, and a lack of
hobbies. Nagelkerke R2 was 51%.This study revealed through multivariate analysis 
that depression was primarily associated with personal behavioral and
psychological factors in Japan, an Eastern country with a holistic cultural
background. This result is consistent with findings from Western countries. This 
study can contribute the promotion and evaluation of preventive measures for
depression in Eastern culture that focus on individual behavioral and
psychological factors.

INTRODUCTION: Primary dysmenorrhea affects 60% of adolescent girls between 14 and
19 years of age and higher rates of depression and absenteeism are found in these
young women. Having developed a sense of coherence (SOC) protects against
depression associated with and improves the experience of primary dysmenorrhea.
The aim of the study was to describe the association between primary dysmenorrhea
and SOC. MéTHODS: A multicentric and cross-sectional study was performed on 247
high school girls from Finistère (France).
RESULTS: Sixty point seven per cent of high school girls suffer from primary
dysmenorrhea: average VAS greater than or equal to 4 out of 10 with an
improvement in pain by analgesics if severe pain (greater than 7 out of 10) to
eliminate secondary dysmenorrhea (3.6% suspected). Thirty five point six per cent
do not present dysmenorrhea (VAS between 0 and 3). This study shows that having a
high SOC reduces menstrual pain (P=0.014). The main treatments used are not those
recommended by Clinical practice guidelines.
DISCUSSION: Interventions based on Comprehensive Sexuality Education, medical
consultations respecting salutogenic model would provide a better quality of life
for adolescent girls by promoting the development of psycho-social skills.

Development of a Salutogenesis Workshop for SPPs to Help Them, Their Athletes,
and the Athlete's Entourage Better Cope With Uncertainty During the COVID-19
Pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic is also called a crisis of uncertainty because of so many
unforeseeable events like canceled qualification competitions, loss of training
facilities, and postponement of the Olympic games. Athletes and their entourage
experience this uncertainty as stressful. Sport psychology practitioners (SPPs)
are in a key position to support athletes in coping with these unforeseeable
stressors. However, SPPs are similarly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and
simultaneously have to cope with stress. Salutogenesis, which describes how to
manage stress and to stay well, provides a theoretical approach to how to cope
with uncertainty. The salutogenetic approach aims at strengthening individuals'
sense of coherence (SoC) and consists of three components, namely
comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness. Although it is known that
the SoC can be enhanced via psychological skills training, so far, this approach 
has not been systematically applied to the elite sport context. Athletes have
been advised to see SPPs for help; thus, the question of how SPPs handle the time
of uncertainty while supporting others emerges. The aim of this contribution was 
to outline how the salutogenetic approach can be applied to strengthening SPPs'
SoC via a single-day four-part workshop. Additionally, we applied the workshop to
N = 26 volleyball coaches and evaluated the workshop's effects on participants'
psychological aspects [i.e., the Sense of Coherence-Leipziger short version
(SoC-L9), resilience (RS-13): coping with uncertainty, affective response, and
stress via semantic differentials] and the workshop's quality ratings (i.e.,
Quality Questionnaire for Sport Psychological Coaching, QS-17). The evaluation
provides results that show a positive impact on a descriptive level of the
participants' SoC, uncertainty, affect, and stress perception; however, the
results show no significant main effect of time [F(8, 10) = 1.04, p = 0.467, η p 
2 = 0.454]. Workshop quality (on average, 3.60 ± 0.35 out of 4.00) and skill
acquisition (on average, 3.00 ± 0.64 out of 4.00) were positively evaluated;
82.00% of the participants would use the learned tools in the future. Thus, we
outline how this workshop might help strengthen SPPs' SoC and at the same time
empower them to strengthen their athletes' SoC. Overall, we add a theoretical
(i.e., salutogenesis in sports) and a practical perspective (i.e., coping
techniques based on salutogenesis) on how to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic for 
SPPS, athletes, and their support network.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to clarify the factors related to
attitudes toward responses to a stress survey in the Stress Check Program, which 
is used to screen for workers with high psychosocial stress at the workplace.
METHODS: An anonymous self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted on
1,800 regular staff member of a financial industry (valid response rate: 72.0%). 
The questionnaire items were the brief job stress questionnaire (BJSQ), the sense
of coherence (SOC-13), the Japanese version of the Utrecht work engagement scale 
(UWES-J), attitudes toward responses to the stress survey, and the concerns of
subjects regarding the stress check program.
RESULTS: The stress in interpersonal relationships at the workplace in the BJSQ, 
"concerns about leaking results to the company", "concerns about receiving
persistent calls for an interview", and "concerns about a disadvantageous
treatment by the company" were positively related to 'writing general truths',
whereas the support from the boss in the BJSQ and the subscales of SOC-13 were
negatively related to 'writing general truths'. The stress in interpersonal
relationships at the workplace and "concerns about receiving persistent calls for
an interview" were positively related to 'writing falsehoods', but the
"dedication" in UWES-J was negatively related to 'writing falsehoods'.
CONCLUSIONS: To obtain authentic answers in the stress survey, it is important
(1) to smooth relationships at the workplace, (2) to devise operation systems
such as an interview guidance, and (3) to provide support that enhances the
ability of workers to cope with stress and work engagement.

BACKGROUND: Stress and low psychological well-being among students in higher
education impact their academic performance. The purpose of this study was to
determine the relationship between SOC, SDLR, and academic performance in year 3,
4, and 5 undergraduate dental students.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and ten students completed a validated
questionnaire on SOC and SDLR. The percentage of marks obtained by these students
in their year-end examination was used as their academic performance. The SOC
scores were further divided into three hierarchical clusters using cluster
analysis. The data were analyzed to determine the difference in the SDLR scores
and academic performance among the three clusters. Furthermore, the relationship 
between SOC scores, SDLR scores, and academic performance was assessed.
RESULTS: The SDLR scores significantly increased from the low SOC cluster to the 
high SOC cluster (P = 0.026). However, there was no significant change in
academic performance. A positive relationship was found between the SOC and the
academic performance (R = +0.025; P > 0.05). The SDLR had a significant positive 
relationship with both SOC and academic performance (R = +0.27; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Although SOC may not have a direct influence on academic performance,
SDLR can play an intermediary role. Early identification and timely intervention 
in students with a weak SOC and low SDLR can have a beneficial influence on their
academic life.

BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic conditions pose a major challenge to the Danish
healthcare system. Since 2018, disease management programmes for patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) were
introduced in Denmark. Treatment in hospitals should be reserved for those
patients who require specialised treatment. Hence, more patients with COPD and
T2D fall within the general practitioners' (GPs) responsibility.
OBJECTIVES: This study explores GPs' perceptions of their role as physicians
responsible for the disease management programmes on COPD and T2D and their
perceptions of the quality of care provided to these patient groups.
METHODS: Between November 2019 and January 2020, we conducted semi-structured
interviews with 14 GPs from the five regions of Denmark. We analysed the
interviews using systematic text condensation inspired by Malterud's thematic
analysis.
RESULTS: The GPs stated that they have been managing the care of COPD and T2D
patients for over a decade, and they considered the quality of care to be high.
They believed that managing patient treatment pathways in general practice
settings contributes to a heightened sense of security for the patient, mainly
because of the long-standing and trusting relationship between the patient and
GP.
CONCLUSION: According to the GPs, they continue to play an important role as
treatment coordinators to ensure coherence and high quality in treating patients 
with COPD and type 2 diabetes.

Since Aaron Antonovsky's salutogenesis theory and Morgan and Ziglio's health
assets model were first proposed, there has been a growing concern to define the 
resources available to the individual and the community to maintain or improve
health and well-being. The aim of the present study was to identify the
dimensions that characterise community assets for health. To this end, we
conducted a systematised review with a meta-synthesis and content analysis of
research or projects involving asset mapping in the community. Articles that met 
our eligibility criteria were: (1) based on the salutogenic approach and (2)
described an assets mapping process and among their results, explained what, how 
and why particular community assets for health had been selected. The search
included primary studies in the published and grey literature which were selected
from websites and electronic databases (Web of Science, MEDLINE, Scopus,
EBSCOhost, Dialnet, SciELO). Of the 607 records examined by a single reviewer, 34
were included in the content analysis and 14 in the qualitative synthesis. Using 
an inductive process, we identified 14 dimensions with 24 categories, for which
in-depth literature reviews were then carried out to define specific indicators
and items. These dimensions were: utility, intention, previous use, accessibility
("circumstances-opportunity-affordability"), proximity-walkability, connectivity,
intelligibility (visibility, transparency), identity (uniqueness,
appropriability, attachment), design (configuration, functionality, comfort),
safety (objective/subjective), diversity, the dimension of public and private,
and sustainability (which includes maintenance, profitability or economic
sustainability, environmental sustainability, centrality-participation and
equity-inclusiveness).

The aim was to explore how midwives, public health nurses and nurses view caring 
in antenatal care (ANC) as provided for mothers and fathers/partners. Based on
Noblit and Hare (1988), meta-ethnography was used to address meaning by
synthesizing knowledge and understanding inductively through selected qualitative
studies (n = 16). Four core themes were identified: (1) supporting the parents to
awaken to parenthood and creating a firm foundation for early parenting and their
new life situation; (2) guiding parents on the path to parenthood and new
responsibility; (3) ensuring normality and the bond between baby and parents
while protecting life; and (4) promoting the health and wellbeing of the family
today and in the future. The overarching theme can be expressed as "helping the
woman and her partner prepare for their new life with the child by providing
individualized, shared care, firmly grounded and with a view of the future".
Caring in antenatal care (ANC) is being totally present, listening and using
multidimensional professional competence but also being open-minded to new
aspects and knowledge. The health promotion and positive health aspects should be
considered an important part of supporting parents and the whole family now and
in the future. A more conscious salutogenic approach to ANC would lead to more
favorable results and could be a fruitful research topic in the future. There is 
a need to provide midwives/nurses with enough time to allow them to concentrate
on specific needs and support for different kind of families in ANC but also
training for midwives to make them more familiar with online and other options.

Nearly a year after the classification of the COVID-19 outbreak as a global
pandemic, it is clear that different factors have contributed to an increase in
psychological disorders, including public health measures that infringe on
personal freedoms, growing financial losses, and conflicting messages. This study
examined the evolution of psychosocial impacts with the progression of the
pandemic in adult populations from different countries and continents, and
identified, among a wide range of individual and country-level factors, which
ones are contributing to this evolving psychological response. An online survey
was conducted in May/June 2020 and in November 2020, among a sample of 17,833
adults (Phase 1: 8806; Phase 2: 9027) from eight countries/regions (Canada, the
United States, England, Switzerland, Belgium, Hong Kong, the Philippines, New
Zealand). Probable generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive
episode (MDE) were assessed. The independent role of potential factors was
examined using multilevel logistic regression. Probable GAD or MDE was indicated 
by 30.1% and 32.5% of the respondents during phases 1 and 2, respectively (a 7.9%
increase over time), with an important variation according to countries/regions
(range from 22.3% in Switzerland to 38.8% in the Philippines). This proportion
exceeded 50% among young adults (18-24 years old) in all countries except for
Switzerland. Beyond young age, several factors negatively influenced mental
health in times of pandemic; important factors were found, including weak sense
of coherence (adjusted odds ratio aOR = 3.89), false beliefs (aOR = 2.33), and
self-isolation/quarantine (aOR = 2.01). The world has entered a new era dominated
by psychological suffering and rising demand for mental health interventions,
along a continuum from health promotion to specialized healthcare. More than
ever, we need to innovate and build interventions aimed at strengthening key
protective factors, such as sense of coherence, in the fight against the
adversity caused by the concurrent pandemic and infodemic.

BACKGROUND: Implementation depends on healthcare professionals being able to make
sense of a new intervention in relation to their routine practice. Normalisation 
Process Theory refers to this as coherence work. However, specifying what it
takes to achieve coherence is challenging because of variations in new
interventions, routine practices and the relationship between them. Frameworks
for intervention description may offer a way forward, as they provide broad
descriptive categories for comparing complex interventions. To date such
frameworks have not been informed by implementation theory, so do not account for
the coherence work involved in holding aspects of routine practice constant while
doing other aspects differently. Using speech and language therapy as an
empirical exemplar, we explored therapists' experiences of practice change and
developed a framework to show how coherence of child speech interventions is
achieved.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-based qualitative study of how
interventions for child speech problems had changed across three NHS speech and
language therapy services and private practice in Scotland. A coherence framework
was derived through interplay between empirical work with 42 therapists (using
in-depth interviews, or self-organised pairs or small focus groups) and
Normalisation Process Theory's construct of coherence.
FINDINGS: Therapists reported a range of practice changes, which had demanded
different types of coherence work. Non-traditional interventions had featured for
many years in the profession's research literature but not in clinical practice. 
Achieving coherence with these interventions was intellectually demanding because
they challenged the traditional linguistic assumptions underpinning routine
practice. Implementation was also logistically demanding, and therapists felt
they had little agency to vary what was locally conventional for their service.
In addition, achieving coherence took considerable relational work.
Non-traditional interventions were often difficult to explain to children and
parents, involved culturally uncomfortable repetitive drills and required
therapists to do more tailoring of intervention for individual children.
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention coherence framework has practical and theoretical
applications. It is designed to help therapists, services and researchers
anticipate and address barriers to achieving coherence when implementing
non-routine interventions. It also represents a worked example of using theory to
make intervention description both user-focused and implementation-friendly.

Background: Most cancer patients' families suffer from maladaptation which
increases family distress and caregiving burden. This study was conducted to
explore the relationship between these maladaptation indicators, and the sense of
coherence (SOC) of family caregivers alongside other family resilience determines
among family caregivers of cancer patients.
Methods: A total of 104 family caregivers of cancer patients were included in
this cross-sectional study. They answered three questionnaires to assess family
resilience factors: Family Inventory of Resources for Management (FIRM), Family
Crisis Oriented Personal Evaluation Scales (F-COPES), and SOC scale. In addition,
family maladaptation factors were determined by two instruments, including Family
Distress Index (FDI) and Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI).
Results: The results of this study showed that the FIRM and the SOC together were
responsible for 35% and 43% of the variances in FDI and CBI scores, respectively 
(P < 0.001). "Reframing", the subscale of the F-COPES, significantly predicted
the variances of FDI (β = -0.26, P = 0.01) and CBI scores (β = -0.21, P = 0.04). 
Moreover, "Mastery and health", the subscale of the FIRM, significantly predicted
the variances of FDI (β = -0.38, P < 0.01) and CBI scores (β = -0.21, P = 0.02).
Conclusions: Family caregiver's SOC alongside other family resilience
determinants plays a significant role in alleviating family distress and
caregiver burden. It is suggested that palliative care providers consider family 
caregivers' SOC in developing a psychological intervention plan to improve family
resilience in families of cancer patients.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To provide insights into what promotes and challenges inner 
strength and willpower in formerly critically ill patients back home after a
long-term ICU stay.
BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients demand great resources during an ICU stay,
some experience great challenges after discharge from hospital. Knowledge about
how health professionals can promote former long-term critically ill patients'
inner strength and willpower after discharge is essential, but still missing.
DESIGN: A qualitative, hermeneutic-phenomenological approach using in-depth
interviews with former long-term ICU patients.
METHODS: Seventeen long-term ICU patients were interviewed 6-20 months after ICU 
discharge. The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research was used 
(COREQ,2007).
RESULTS: Back home after hospital discharge, some former patients coped well
while others suffered heavy burdens mentally and physically, along with economic 
problems. They handled their challenges differently: some found comfort and
insight by reading their diary written by their ICU nurses, while several were
struggling alone experiencing a lonesome silent suffering; these called for a
follow-up support by the healthcare system.
CONCLUSION: Long-term ICU patients' inner strength and willpower are vital
salutogenic resources supporting the fight back to one's former independent life.
However, physical, mental and economic challenges drain their inner strength to
go on and succeed. Several long-term ICU patients need health-promoting follow-up
support after hospital discharge.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study disclosed a lonely and silent
suffering indicating a need for development of systematical health-promoting
follow-up programmes including salutogenic components such as health-promoting
conversations, diaries and web-based recovery programme along with a cell phone
app.

PURPOSE: Sense of coherence (SOC) represents coping and can be considered an
essential component of mental health. SOC correlates with mental health and
personality, but the background of these associations is poorly understood. We
analyzed the role of genetic factors behind the associations of SOC with mental
health, self-esteem and personality using genetic twin modeling and polygenic
scores (PGS).
METHODS: Information on SOC (13-item Orientation of Life Questionnaire), four
mental health indicators, self-esteem and personality (NEO Five Factor Inventory 
Questionnaire) was collected from 1295 Finnish twins at 20-27 years of age.
RESULTS: In men and women, SOC correlated negatively with depression,
alexithymia, schizotypal personality and overall mental health problems and
positively with self-esteem. For personality factors, neuroticism was associated 
with weaker SOC and extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness with
stronger SOC. All these psychological traits were influenced by genetic factors
with heritability estimates ranging from 19 to 66%. Genetic and environmental
factors explained these associations, but the genetic correlations were generally
stronger. The PGS of major depressive disorder was associated with weaker, and
the PGS of general risk tolerance with stronger SOC in men, whereas in women the 
PGS of subjective well-being was associated with stronger SOC and the PGSs of
depression and neuroticism with weaker SOC.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that a substantial proportion of genetic
variation in SOC is shared with mental health, self-esteem and personality
indicators. This suggests that the correlations between these traits reflect a
common neurobiological background rather than merely the influence of external
stressors.

The combination of psychosocial working conditions, occupational balance and
sociodemographic characteristics and their associations with no or negligible
stress symptoms among Swedish occupational therapists - a cross-sectional study.

BACKGROUND: The numbers of people who are on sick leave due to mental health
problems, such as exhaustion disorder, are increasing in Sweden. One of the most 
affected groups is healthcare professionals. In order to develop preventive
strategies to promote a sustainable working life for occupational therapists,
there is a need to understand the associations between psychosocial working
conditions, occupational balance and no or negligible stress symptoms. To the
best of our knowledge, neither the combination of these factors nor the
salutogenic perspective, have been taken into consideration when exploring
factors associated with stress symptoms among occupational therapists in previous
research.
METHODS: Purposeful sampling was used. All currently working members of the
Swedish Association of Occupational Therapists were invited to take part in the
present study in 2018. The final sample was 3658 (48% response rate). A
web-survey with questions about signs of exhaustion, psychosocial working
conditions, occupational balance and sociodemographic characteristics was used.
Logistic regression analyses were used in order to calculate associations between
psychosocial working conditions, occupational balance, sociodemographic
characteristics and no or negligible signs of exhaustion.
RESULTS: Experiencing high occupational balance, low workload, high control, high
sense of community and high justice, were associated with no or negligible stress
symptoms. Furthermore, a satisfying financial situation, having children living
at home, being married and long professional experience were significant in this 
model.
CONCLUSIONS: It seems important to consider not only psychosocial working
conditions, but also occupational balance to prevent exhaustion disorder among
occupational therapists in Sweden. Organisational programmes, which reduce the
workload, strengthen the control and sense of community and facilitate
occupational balance, seem to be important areas for health promotion in this
group.

BACKGROUND: Precarious employment has affected mental health, and limited data
are available on the association of low stress tolerance with depressive symptoms
among Japanese workers.
AIMS: This study aimed to examine the relationship between stress tolerance and
depressive symptoms among Japanese workers, including company employees, civil
servants and self-employed persons in various industries.
METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional study. From March 26 to April 
6, 2020, we performed a web-based survey of Japanese workers. The questionnaire
included questions on socioeconomic factors, the SOC scale that assesses stress
tolerance, the CES-D, and the EQ-5D-5L. Multivariate regression analyses were
performed to determine the factors associated with depressive symptoms.
RESULTS: We included 3,001 participants in the analysis. A high SOC score,
adequate sleeping time and frequency of exercise were associated with higher
depressive symptoms. Employment status and long working hours were not associated
with depressive symptoms. Younger workers had lower SOC scores than older
workers. An inverse correlation between the SOC score and CES-D score was found
among Japanese workers.
CONCLUSIONS: Improving stress tolerance among younger workers is needed to
prevent worsening mental health regardless of employment status for Japanese
workers.

Background: Teachers constitute an occupational group experiencing high levels of
stress and with high sick-leave rates. Therefore, examining potentially
protective factors is important. While prior research has mainly focused on the
link between teachers' own experiences of their work environment and
stress-related outcomes, it is also possible that colleagues' perception of the
work environment and their possibilities for dealing with work-related stress
contribute to influencing individual teachers' stress. Aim: The aim of this study
was to investigate how teachers' reports of high job strain (i.e. high demands
and low control) and sense of coherence (SOC), as well as the concentration of
colleagues reporting high strain and high SOC, were associated with perceived
stress and depressed mood. Methods: The data were derived from the Stockholm
Teacher Survey, with information from two cross-sectional web surveys performed
in 2014 and in 2016 (N=2732 teachers in 205 school units). Two-level random
intercept linear regression models were performed. Results: High job strain at
the individual level was associated with higher levels of perceived stress and
depressed mood, but less so for individuals with high SOC. Furthermore, a greater
proportion of colleagues reporting high SOC was associated with lower levels of
perceived stress and depressed mood at the individual level. Conclusions: High
SOC may be protective against work-related stress among teachers. Additionally,
the proportion of colleagues reporting high SOC was related to less individual
stress, suggesting a protective effect of school-level collective SOC.

BACKGROUND: Rare disease patients are geographically dispersed, posing challenges
to research. Some researchers have partnered with patient organizations and used 
web-based approaches to overcome geographic recruitment barriers. Critics of such
methods claim that samples are homogenous and do not represent the broader
patient population-as patients recruited from patient organizations are thought
to have high levels of needs. We applied latent class mixture modeling (LCMM) to 
define patient clusters based on underlying characteristics. We used previously
collected data from a cohort of patients with congenital hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism who were recruited online in collaboration with a patient
organization. Patient demographics, clinical information, Revised Illness
Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) scores and Zung self-rating depression Scale
(SDS) were used as variables for LCMM analysis. Specifically, we aimed to test
the classic critique that patients recruited online in collaboration with a
patient organization are a homogenous group with high needs. We hypothesized that
distinct classes (clinical profiles) of patients could be identified-thereby
demonstrating the validity of online recruitment and supporting transferability
of findings.
RESULTS: In total, 154 patients with CHH were included. The LCMM analysis
identified three distinct subgroups (Class I: n = 84 [54.5%], Class II: n = 41
[26.6%], Class III: n = 29 [18.8%]) that differed significantly in terms of age, 
education, disease consequences, emotional consequences, illness coherence and
depression symptoms (all p < 0.001) as well as age at diagnosis (p = 0.045).
Classes depict a continuum of psychosocial impact ranging from severe to
relatively modest. Additional analyses revealed later diagnosis (Class I:
19.2 ± 6.7 years [95% CI 17.8-20.7]) is significantly associated with worse
psychological adaptation and coping as assessed by disease consequences,
emotional responses, making sense of one's illness and SDS depressive symptoms
(all p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: We identify three distinct classes of patients who were recruited
online in collaboration with a patient organization. Findings refute prior
critiques of patient partnership and web-based recruitment for rare disease
research. This is the first empirical data suggesting negative psychosocial
sequelae of later diagnosis ("diagnostic odyssey") often observed in CHH.

Introduction: Universities are an essential setting for creating health promoting
environments. Evidence shows that university life can pose various threats to the
students' health. Especially first year students are vulnerable to mental health 
issues. To support well-being and prevent psychological distress from the first
day of studying, onboarding programs are needed to promote the students' health
and their self- and social competencies. The study demonstrates a tailored
multi-component onboarding intervention program named "Healthy Study Start." An
evaluation of the effectiveness is presented focusing on outcomes regarding the
students' sense of coherence (S-SoC), social support, sympathy, the work-related 
collective and the participative safety (a sub-scale of the team climate) among
freshmen at the Carinthia University of Applied Sciences (CUAS, Austria).
Methods: For the analyses, a quantitative controlled study design was used and
results were measured three times. The intervention group (n = 72) was composed
of freshmen selected from the bachelor study programs Occupational Therapy,
Speech and Language Therapy, Biomedical Science and Radiologic Technology.
Freshmen from the bachelor study program Healthcare and Nursing formed the
control group (n = 81). As the requirements for analyses of variance were not
fulfilled, the data had to be analyzed using e.g., Mann-Whitney U-tests. Results:
Significant changes (all p < 0.016) between the two groups were found between
T0/T1, and between T0/T2. Furthermore, changes within the intervention group (all
p < 0.016) emerged in nearly all outcomes between T0/T1, while within the control
group no changes were identified. However, the intervention group had
statistically significantly higher values in the majority of outcomes at T1 and
T2 compared to the control group. Conclusion: The onboarding program "Healthy
Study Start" shows how an initiative at the beginning of their studies can
support students in entering a new phase of their lives. The results indicate a
positive effect on the students' self- and social competencies. However,
students' health promotion is not only an investment for a health conscious
university or an enhanced employability. Especially in health-related fields of
study, students are future multipliers and play an essential role in implementing
health promotion concepts for clients, patients and employees.

of chronic disease: viability and value for the care of cardiovascular
conditions.

Health promotion provides a complementary scientific and practical approach to
medicine, which may help to create, maintain and restore wellness even in the
presence of disease and illness. Salutogenesis, as key concept, focuses upon the 
emergence of health and thus, leads to fortifying individuals' and communities'
health determinants and resources. The potential integration of health promotion 
and medicine can contribute to a more person-centred focus of integrative care to
address and realize individuals' health potential and needs, rather than merely
an emphasis upon the underlying disease, such as congenital heart diseases. We
posit that it is possible-and advisable-to address lifestyle modification
aspects, and to change the focus of therapeutic encounters and health care
programs to be more tailored to and aligned with individual needs, demands and
expectations. By adopting a health promotional approach to the individual patient
as person, their subjective biography, narrative and lifeworld can serve as
resources for developing more beneficial coping styles, resilience and
trajectories for personal growth over the life span, despite the occurrence and
durability of chronic conditions, such as long-term cardiovascular disease.
Implications, important contingencies and requirements for education and training
of health-care professionals are addressed, as they are key issues that may
affect the successful development and engagement of health promotion programs
within health care systems at-large.

Perception of family sense of coherence among Chinese couples with infertility.

Ngai FW(1), Lam W(1).

Author information:

Hong Kong SAR.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore perceptions of family sense of coherence among
infertile couples and to provide a theoretical interpretation of the
comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness of couples' experiences
coping with infertility.
BACKGROUND: Infertility is a devastating experience for many couples and can have
long-lasting psychosocial consequences. Family sense of coherence has the
potential to facilitate a couple's adjustment to the life crisis of infertility
and may provide a useful conceptual lens to understand experiences of
infertility.
METHODS: Sixty-four couples with infertility participated in semi-structured
interviews at subfertility clinics. Data were analysed using the constant
comparative approach of grounded theory. COREQ guidelines were followed in
reporting the study.
RESULTS: Three major themes related to infertility emerged from the interviews:
comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness. The couples experienced
psychological strain while making cognitive sense of infertility. The
significance of children, which is embedded in traditional Chinese culture,
created a sense of meaning and purpose in couples' lives and motivated them to
mobilise both internal and external resources to cope with the demands of
infertility and its treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the salutogenic model of family sense of 
coherence can contribute to our understanding of the experiences of infertility
among Chinese couples.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The results offer a theoretical framework that
healthcare professionals can use to help couples cope with the life crisis of
infertility by strengthening their sense of family coherence.

Author information: 
(1)Karlstad University, Karlstad, Sweden.
(2)University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to investigate aspects related to
difficulty to retain nursing assistants at nursing homes in Sweden related to
perceived work environment characteristics.
DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: To reveal aspects related to difficulty to retain
nursing assistants, the paper uses the BIKVA model, sense of coherence and New
Public Management (NPM). In total, three focus groups with nursing assistants at 
three nursing homes are interviewed with corresponding individual interviews with
their senior managers and users. The purpose is to analyze the situation from the
affected group of nursing assistants. The focus of this study is how nursing
assistants discuss related to recruit and retain nursing assistants at nursing
homes and elderly care and the response from senior management related to those
aspects.
FINDINGS: The main conclusions are that nursing assistants consider their job as 
meaningful, but limited latitude and direct involvement in managing their daily
tasks in a continuous communication with management affect negatively.
Furthermore and combined with wage levels, aspects related to scheduling, working
hours, shift work, split shifts and understaffing generate a burdensome and
stressful environment affecting the possibility to retain staff in a negative
direction.
ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The research uses a new approach utilizing the BIKVA model,
sense of coherence and NPM. The study shows that central in retaining nursing
assistants at nursing homes relates to aspects such as wages, staffing, shift
work and split shifts and continuous communication between nursing assistants and
management.

BACKGROUND: Glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) is an anatomofunctional
impairment of the optic nerve triggered by glaucoma. Recently, growth factors
(GFs) have been shown to produce retinal neuroenhancement. The suprachoroidal
autograft of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by the Limoli retinal restoration
technique (LRRT) has proven to achieve retinal neuroenhancement by producing GF
directly into the choroidal space. This retrospectively registered clinical study
investigated the visual function changes in patients with GON treated with LRRT.
METHODS: Twenty-five patients (35 eyes) with GON in progressive disease
conditions were included in the study. Each patient underwent a comprehensive
ocular examination, including the analysis of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)
for far and near visus, sensitivity by Maia microperimetry, and the study of the 
spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The patients were divided 
into two groups: a control group, consisting of 21 eyes (average age 72.2 years, 
range 50-83), and an LRRT group, consisting of 14 eyes (average age 67.4, range
50-84).
RESULTS: After 6 months, the BCVA, close-up visus, and microperimetric
sensitivity significantly improved in the LRRT-treated group (p<0.05), whereas
the mean increases were not statistically significant in controls (p>0.5).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with GON treated with LRRT showed a significant increase in
visual performance (VP) both in BCVA and sensitivity and an improvement of
residual close-up visus, in the comparison between the LRRT results and the
control group. Further studies will be needed to establish the actual
significance of the reported findings.

Hospital Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.

OBJECTIVE: A history of an eating disorder (ED) might constitute a risk for
symptom deterioration and relapse during COVID-19 pandemic. This longitudinal
study investigates ED symptom trajectories until the first COVID-19 lockdown in
Spring 2020 in patients with a history of binge eating disorder (BED).
METHOD: Participants of the randomised-controlled BED treatment trial IMPULS
participated in a re-assessment directly after the first COVID-19 lockdown in
Germany. We used expert-rated clinical interviews and self-report to investigate 
binge eating (BE) frequency, ED and general psychopathology, distress, emotion
regulation and sense of coherence. Symptom trajectories were analysed for
baseline when entering the trial, end of trial participation and the time point
directly after lockdown. BE frequency was assessed on a recall basis for 4 weeks 
directly before lockdown and 4 weeks during lockdown.
RESULTS: BE frequency, general ED pathology and depressive symptoms markedly
increased after as compared to before the COVID-19 outbreak. Individuals scoring 
high on reappraisal as emotion regulation strategy and sense of coherence scored 
lower on general ED pathology.
CONCLUSION: Individuals with a history of an ED are at risk for symptom
deterioration and relapse during the pandemic. Intervention and service
dissemination strategies are needed to support vulnerable groups throughout the
pandemic.

Rydygier Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Bydgoszcz, Poland.
(2)Faculty of Psychology, Kazimierz Wielki University in Bydgoszcz, Bydgoszcz,
Poland.

AIM: The main objective of this paper was to establish types of health status in 
the group of practicing nurses.
DESIGN: Positive psychology defines human health as the underlying resource for
all life activities, including professional work. Practicing nurses are exposed
to a variety of professional pressures, most notably high-stress burden.
Long-term functioning in conditions of work-related overburden and stress may
compromise the health status of nurses and make them vulnerable to somatic or
psychosomatic conditions.
METHODS: In this study, we used original worksheets for collecting socio-economic
data and health-related data, Orientation to Life Questionnaire (SOC-29), General
Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), Brief COPE Inventory (Mini-COPE) and the somatic
symptom scale. K-means clustering analysis for cases was used to identify types
of health status among the surveyed nurses.
RESULTS: This survey discovered that specific types of health status can be
distinguished among practicing nurses. The nurses represented various types of
health status, levels of the sense of coherence and the use of stress management 
strategies.

OBJECTIVE: Early childhood caries (ECC) is caries in children below the age of
72 months. The aim of the study was to determine the association of maternal
psychosocial factors (general anxiety, dental anxiety, sense of coherence,
parenting stress, fatalism, social support, depressive symptoms, and executive
dysfunction), decision-making abilities, education, income and caries status with
the prevalence and severity of ECC among children resident in Ile-Ife, Nigeria.
METHODS: A dataset of 1549 mother-child (6-71-months-old) dyads collected through
examinations and a household survey, using validated psychometric tools to
measure the psychosocial factors, were analyzed. The DMFT for the mothers and the
dmft for the child were determined. The association between maternal psychosocial
factors, education, income, and decision-making ability, the prevalence of
maternal caries, and the prevalence of ECC was determined using logistic
regression analysis.
RESULTS: The prevalence of maternal caries was 3.3%, and the mean (standard
deviation-SD) DMFT was 0.10 (0.76). The ECC prevalence was 4.3%, and the mean
(SD) dmft was 0.13 (0.92). There was no significant difference between the
prevalence and severity of maternal caries and ECC by maternal age, education,
income, or decision-making abilities. There was also no significant difference in
maternal caries, ECC prevalence and ECC severity by maternal psychosocial
factors. The only significant association was between the prevalence of caries in
the mother and children: children whose mothers had caries were over six times
more likely to have ECC than were children with mothers who had no caries (AOR:
6.67; 95% CI 3.23-13.79; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The significant association between ECC and maternal caries
prevalence suggests that prenatal oral health care for mothers may reduce the
risk for ECC.

BACKGROUND: Person-centred care (PCC) empowers patients to manage their chronic
illness and promote their health in accordance with their own beliefs, values and
preferences. Drawing on health-care professional's (HCP's) experiences
implementing an empowerment-focused, person-centred intervention called the
Bodyknowledging Program (BKP), we undertook a process evaluation that aimed to
assess the impact on patient health and well-being.
METHODS: We used individual in-depth interviews and semi-structured focus groups 
comprising n = 8 interprofessional HCP who facilitated intervention sessions with
n = 58 patients situated in Norwegian specialist care sites. Content analysis was
used to analyse the data and summarize major themes.
RESULTS: Health-care professional interviews revealed four main ways in which the
intervention operated in support of health-related patient outcomes: (i)
addressing the whole person; (ii) hope and affirmation; (iii) expanding recovery;
and (iv) social support and revitalized relationships. The intervention provided 
new tools for patients to understand the social, emotional and physical impact of
their illness. Health-care professional reported new insights to facilitate
patient engagement and to promote patients' health.
CONCLUSIONS: The Bodyknowledging Program facilitated patient engagement through
the promotion of patient-centred care while developing the patients' ability to
exploit their own resources for effectively managing their health within illness.
The process evaluation supported the underlying theoretical basis of the
intervention and was suggestive of its potential transferability elsewhere.

OBJECTIVES: A conceptual model was designed to examine interrelations among
psychosocial factors, oral health behaviour, and dental caries in a sample of
adolescents.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study design of 531 Greek families included an oral
examination and a survey completed by adolescents, and a survey completed by
mothers. The outcome measure was dental caries experience. Additionally, dental
sealants were recorded. The participants provided information which comprised the
Sense of Coherence (SoC) scale and 11 psychosocial and behavioural variables that
formed 6 composite variables (life-course experiences, socio-economic status,
perceived parental support, perceived parental punishment, preventive measures,
sugar intake frequency). The composite variables of preventive measures and sugar
intake formed the latent variable of oral health behaviour. The interrelations of
the above factors were included in a conceptual model and tested using a
Structural Equation Modelling analysis.
RESULTS: Data fit the proposed conceptual model (χ2  = 23.338, df = 14, P = .055,
RMSEA = 0.036). Among psychosocial variables, adolescent's SoC was the best
predictor of both dental caries (Standardized Regression Coefficient - Std.
RC ± Standard Error (SE) = -0.178 ± 0.04) and oral health behaviour (Std.
RC ± SE = -0.378 ± 0.09). All psychosocial factors were associated with SoC (Std.
RCs ± SE between -0.162 ± 0.04 and 0.211 ± 0.04) and via SoC with oral health
behaviour (Std. RCs ± SE between -0.080 ± 0.03 and 0.061 ± 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: A conceptual model was tested that integrated SoC with the
psychosocial factors theoretically shaping it and clarified all factors'
predictive abilities on dental caries via oral health behaviour.

Mobility-A Bridge to Sense of Coherence in Everyday Life: Older Patients'
Experiences of Participation in an Exercise Program During the First 3 Weeks
After Hip Fracture Surgery.

Vestøl I(1), Debesay J(1), Bergland A(1).

Author information: 
(1)Oslo Metropolitan University, Oslo, Norway.

Our aim with this article was to explore the experiences of older people who
participated in the evidence-based High-Intensity Functional Exercise (HIFE)
Program during the first 3 weeks of rehabilitation after hip fracture surgery.
Nineteen older people participated in the study. Data were analyzed using
systematic text condensation. One overarching theme "Exercise is the key for
regaining mobility and a sense of coherence (SOC) in everyday life" emerged from 
the analysis in addition to these five themes: (a) understanding the existential 
importance of mobility; (b) maintaining a positive self-image by regaining
mobility; (c) regaining one's old life and independence in everyday living; (d)
maintaining interpersonal relationships through mobility; and (e) creating
positive emotions by being able to move. The findings highlight the importance of
exercise as a strategy for regaining mobility, illustrated by the essential role 
it played in the participants' lives after suffering a hip fracture.

Wroclaw, Poland.

This study aimed to evaluate the emotional state and the level of the sense of
coherence in the context of physical activity among physiotherapy students and
investigate how the participating students' emotional state changed after two
years of studying and what factors were associated with the mood disorders. The
study group consisted of 110 students-79 female and 31 male. The Back Depression 
Inventory (BDI), the Sense of Coherence Questionnaire (SOC-29) and the Perceived 
Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) were used. The results presented an increase in
depressive symptoms during the studies of a group of physiotherapy students.
Physical activity can play a protective role in the prevention and treatment of
mood disorders. The students who regularly engaged in physical activity exhibited
better mood, a lower perceived stress level and a higher level of the sense of
coherence as compared to the physically inactive students.

Sporto 6, 44221 Kaunas, Lithuania.

The present study expands the existing literature and supplements today's
knowledge on the relationship between personal, psychosocial and lifestyle
factors and depressive symptoms among adolescents. The study aimed to investigate
the variety of depressive symptoms predictors-personal resources, adverse school 
and family, health, lifestyle-related (sense of coherence, self-esteem, school
involvement, negative acts at school, family stress and violence, psychosomatic
health complaints, physical activity, smoking, alcohol) as well as gender,
employing hierarchical linear regression analysis in a large representative
sample of adolescents (N = 2212) in Kaunas, Lithuania. Four blocks of predictors 
were employed in hierarchical linear regression analysis. In the final model
64.9% of depressive symptoms were explained by all the predictors. Sense of
coherence was the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms (standardized
regression coefficient β = -605, p < 0.001 in the first model and β = -263, p <
0.001 in the final model after adjustment for all other independent variables)
and accounted for 36.6% of variance. In conclusion, this study supports the
notion that depressive symptoms among adolescents have multifactorial origins
with many predictors showing significant effect seizes. Therefore, high sense of 
coherence and self-esteem, school involvement, higher levels of physical activity
would be protective and influence lower levels of depressive symptoms among
adolescents. Exposure to negative acts at school and negative experiences in the 
family, psychosomatic health complaints, smoking would increase the probability
of depressive symptoms. Girls are more prone to depression as compared to boys.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, digital health literacy (DHL) has become a
significant public health concern. This research aims to assess information
seeking behavior, as well as the ability to find relevant information and deal
with DHL among university students in Pakistan. An online-based cross-sectional
survey, using a web-based interviewing technique, was conducted to collect data
on DHL. Simple bivariate and multivariate linear regression was performed to
assess the association of key characteristics with DHL. The results show a high
DHL related to COVID-19 in 54.3% of students. Most of the Pakistani students
demonstrated ~50% DHL in all dimensions, except for reliability. Multivariate
findings showed that gender, sense of coherence and importance of information
were found to be significantly associated with DHL. However, a negative
association was observed with students' satisfaction with information. This led
to the conclusion that critical operational and navigations skills are essential 
to achieve COVID-19 DHL and cope with stress, particularly to promote both
personal and community health. Focused interventions and strategies should be
designed to enhance DHL amongst university students to combat the pandemic.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) disrupts the world of work, new
technologies change the nature of individuals' work and their tasks, and
therefore it is necessary to determine how managers cope with these changes,
specifically relating to their salutogenesis. There is a lack of research
conducted on the salutogenesis of managers in times of the 4IR. The purpose of
this study is to investigate the level of managers' sense of coherence (SOC) in
terms of the adjustments and developments of the 4IR, and their in-depth
understanding of their SOC. This study employs a hermeneutical research design
with a qualitative approach by using a semi-structured interview. The method used
to analyze the data was content analysis. From the data analysis, the findings
indicate that a majority of the managers tend to have an understanding of the 4IR
and what implications of the 4IR will have on the world of work and their job
description, the necessary resources to cope with the 4IR, and find the 4IR
meaningful, therefore, managers have a strong SOC level during the 4IR. The
recommendations for future studies suggest that research could be conducted how
managers and lower-level managers' SOC differ, which will provide insight into
what different methods are required for the different level of managers.

How Elderly Residents in Nursing Homes Handle Loneliness-From the Nurses'
Perspective.

Introduction: Elderly people who leave their home environment and move to a
nursing home enter a phase in life with diminishing contact with family and
friends. This situation often results in a feeling of loneliness with a
concomitant deterioration in physical and mental health. By exploring the topic
through the lens of the nurses, this study takes a novel approach to address an
under-researched area in the nursing field.
Objective: The objective of the study was to identify, based on the nurses'
experience, how elderly residents handle loneliness in the nursing home.
Methods: This study used a qualitative explorative approach with data collected
through two focus group interviews with nine nurses at two elderly care
facilities in Norway. The resulting transcripts were examined using an approach
based on inductive content analysis.
Results: Three main categories emerged as crucial to help lonely nursing home
residents cope with day-to-day life: (i) maintaining ties to one's earlier life; 
(ii) engaging in recreational pursuits; and (iii) building new networks.
Conclusion: Analysing the findings based on sense of coherence (SOC) and
person-centred care (PCC) theories illustrates the importance of maintaining a
connection with both family and friends. To that point, having access to familiar
objects from their earlier life seemingly provides meaning to the residents by
bridging the past and the present. Recreational activities, ideally adapted to
each person's needs and ability, have a positive impact by providing structure
and meaning that help overtake feelings of loneliness. Building a new network
with fellow residents and staff imparts a sense of meaningful community belonging
and projects both dignity and self-worth.

BACKGROUND/AIM: To describe the clinical progress and management of ocular side
effects in a 35-year-old patient with metastatic breast cancer who underwent oral
chemotherapy with capecitabine and lapatinib.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Slit lamp evaluation revealed bilateral perikeratic
hyperemia, perilimbal conjunctival edema associated with corneal marginal
infiltrates and epithelial and anterior stromal defects in both eyes. Slit lamp
examination, in vivo confocal microscopy and anterior-segment optical coherence
tomography were highly suggestive for limbal stem cell deficiency. The decision
to administer autologous blood- derived serum eye drops was made.
RESULTS: Following administration of autologous blood-derived serum eye drops,
corneal marginal infiltrates, epithelial and stromal defects significantly
regressed in both eyes after only 10 days. Chemotherapy was resumed and serum eye
drops were prescribed simultaneously.
CONCLUSION: Autologous blood-derived serum eye drops may be an adequate
therapeutic choice for bilateral corneal lesions detected as ocular side effects 
of capecitabine.

[I don't know whether I'm coming or going-Challenges of part-time students during
the COVID-19 pandemic].

Oberbettringer Str. 200, Schwäbisch Gmünd, 73525 Deutschland.

Background: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, universities had to switch to online
teaching as quickly as possible. Part-time students who work in the healthcare
sector have to manage the balancing act between an invariably online education
and a mandatory physical attendance in a profession that maintains the system.
Aim: The aim of the study was to explore the challenges faced by part-time
students working in the healthcare sector, to identify the need for change and to
derive recommendations for action for the university.
Methods: The data were collected using an open response online questionnaire. The
obtained data were evaluated according to the qualitative content analysis of
Mayring.
Results: Probably the greatest challenges that part-time students have to deal
with, are the self-organized learning or the (on time) accomplishment of work
assignments, which are often perceived as too extensive, and the independent
development of teaching content. Furthermore, part-time students reported about
the difficultness to reconcile e‑learning and work and/or family.
Conclusion: These perceived challenges are not new but since additional family
commitments and uncertainty of daily work routine are added, these challenges are
gaining in importance during COVID-19. Therefore, learning environments, which
are currently offered to part-time students, must be understood as caring spaces.
In addition to new didactic concepts, universities should invest in the promotion
of students' personal and social competencies.

Suffering and Salutogenesis: A Conceptual Analysis of Lessons for Psychiatry From
Existential Positive Psychology (PP2.0) in the Setting of the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Rajkumar RP(1).

Education and Research, Pondicherry, India.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a widespread effect on the thoughts, emotions and
behavior of millions of people all around the world. In this context, a large
body of scientific literature examining the mental health impact of this global
crisis has emerged. The majority of these studies have framed this impact in
terms of pre-defined categories derived from psychiatric nosology, such as
anxiety disorders, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. These constructs
often fail to capture the complexity of the actual experiences of the individuals
being studied; more specifically, they describe these experiences exclusively in 
terms of disease, while neglecting their potentially adaptive or "salutogenic"
aspects. Similarly, discussion of psychological assistance for these individuals 
has largely been confined to a reiteration of "evidence-based" psychological or
pharmacological techniques which can be delivered using remote access technology.
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, these approaches are likely to be of
mixed efficacy. Conversely, "negative emotions" or distressing psychological
experiences may actually be functional in the setting of a disaster or crisis,
serving to minimize harm, maximize social coherence and compliance, and
facilitate adherence to safety measures. The limitations of the "conventional"
approach are, to a certain degree, inherent to the prevailing medical model of
mental health. Beyond these considerations lies the concept of "salutogenesis," a
term which refers to the innate capacity of individuals to create and maintain
health and well-being in the face of adversity. Using principles derived from the
second wave of positive psychology (PP2.0), particularly its emphasis on the
totality of human experience and the possibility of deriving meaning and
character growth from suffering, this paper conceptually analyses the relevant
aspects of salutogenesis and PP2.0, and proposes an alternate approach for
addressing mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an approach,
while acknowledging the utility of the conventional medical-psychotherapeutic
model in specific cases, reduces the risk of medicalizing human experience, and
provides individuals and communities with opportunities for growth and
adaptation. The benefits of this proposal could potentially extend far beyond the
current crisis, offering an opportunity for the field of psychiatry and mental
health research to move away from a purely "disease-centered" model.

Sense of coherence and burnout in nursing home workers during the COVID-19
pandemic in Spain.

Care staff in nursing homes work in a challenging environment, and the COVID-19
pandemic has exacerbated those challenges in an unprecedented way. On the other
hand, the sense of coherence (SOC) is a competence that could help these
professionals perceive the situation as understandable, manageable and
meaningful. This study aims to analyse the extent to which potential risk and
protective factors against burnout have affected nursing home workers during the 
COVID-19 pandemic and to assess the contribution of these factors to their
burnout. Three hundred forty professionals who worked in nursing homes in Spain
completed a survey and reported on their sociodemographic characteristics and
their organisational characteristics of the job related to COVID-19, SOC and
burnout. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed. The results showed
that the SOC is highly related to the dimensions of burnout and is a protective
factor against this. In addition, the increase in hours has a negative effect,
facilitating inadequate responses to stressful situations; and whereas perceived 
social support and availability of resources have a protective effect, the
deterioration in mental and physical health is the most important risk factor.
This study could help better understand the psychological consequences of the
effort that nursing home workers and can also help design mental health
prevention and care interventions for workers that provide them with resources
and supports that foster their coping skills.

Context: Adolescents experience many types of gingival and periodontal diseases, 
including gingivitis, localized or generalized aggressive periodontitis, and
periodontal complications of various systemic diseases. The occurrence of
periodontal diseases is not only related to biotic factors but may also be
affected by nonbiotic factors such as oral health behaviors and practices.
Various factors that influence an individual's health-related behaviors include a
psychosocial construct named sense of coherence (SOC).
Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate the association of SOC with oral
health behaviors and gingival bleeding.
Settings and Design: This was a cross-sectional, analytical study that was done
in the school setting.
Materials and Methods: A random sample of 850 adolescents was selected from nine 
schools of the Faridabad block of Faridabad district (Haryana) through the
multistage cluster sampling technique. Methods of data collection included a
combination of questionnaire administration and clinical examination. The
questionnaire comprised sociodemographic variables, questions related to oral
health behaviors, and Antonovsky's SOC scale. The questionnaire was interviewer
administered.
Statistical Analysis: Unadjusted and adjusted rate ratios of gingival units
having bleeding on probing were estimated by Poisson regression multilevel
analysis in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software for
Microsoft Office.
Results: Adolescents whose mothers had studied <8 years (relative risk [RR] 1.26;
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.38), who were males (RR 1.198; 95% CI
1.01-1.29), low SOC (RR 15.93; 95% CI 13.06-19.35), and toothbrushing frequency
of less than once a day (RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.21-1.67) and children with plaque
index >1 (RR 2.765; 95% CI 2.12-3.25) presented with the higher number of
gingival units having bleeding.
Conclusion: SOC is associated with gingival bleeding through oral health
behaviors.

BACKGROUND: This study adapted the Sense of Coherence (SOC) Scale for Korean
adolescents with chronic diseases and evaluated its psychometric properties.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to validate the Sense of Coherence Scale for Korean
adolescents with Chronic Disease (SOC-AC).
DESIGN AND METHODS: This study employed the cross-sectional design. In total, 144
adolescents with chronic diseases (age: 15.07 ± 1.62 years; 58% male) responded
to the study questionnaire, which included the 13-item SOC scale (SOC-13) and the
10-item Children's Depression Inventory. The SOC-13 was shortened to create the
10-item SOC-AC. Through an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and a confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA).
RESULTS: Following the EFA, two items (Item 8 and 13) with low factor loadings
were deleted. Further, following the CFA, one item (Item 2) with a high
modification index was deleted. The resulting 10-item SOC-AC exhibited a 3-factor
structure comprising the subscales of meaningfulness (Item 4, 7, and 12),
comprehensibility-manageability (Item 3, 5, 9, and 11), and resilience (Item 1,
6, and 10). The internal consistency of the SOC-AC was 0.868; the Cronbach's
alpha values were 0.765, 0.78, and 0.529 for the meaningfulness,
comprehensibility-manageability, and resilience subscales. The Pearson's
correlation coefficient for the association between the SOC-13 and depression
showed acceptable criterion-related validity (r = -0.436, p < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the SOC-AC has satisfactory
psychometric properties and that it is useful for assessing SOC in adolescents
with chronic diseases.
PRACTICE IMPLICATION: This study revealed the utility of the examined scale to
measure SOC as a means of health promotion and care in adolescents with chronic
diseases.

INTRODUCTION: The crisis situation generated by COVID-19 and the measures adopted
have generated social changes in the normal dynamics of the general population
and especially for health workers, who find themselves caring for patients with
suspected or confirmed infection. Recent studies have detected in them depression
and anxiety symptoms and burnout syndrome, with personal and social conditions
impacting their response capacity during the health emergency. Our aim was to
generate recommendations for the promotion and protection of the mental health of
health workers and teams in the first line of care in the health emergency due to
COVID-19.
METHODS: A rapid literature search was carried out in PubMed and Google Scholar, 
and an iterative expert consensus and through electronic consultation, with 13
participants from the areas of psychology, psychiatry and medicine; the grading
of its strength and directionality was carried out according to the international
standards of the Joanna Briggs Institute.
RESULTS: Thirty-one recommendations were generated on self-care of health
workers, community care among health teams, screening for alarm signs in mental
health and for health institutions.
CONCLUSIONS: The promotion and protection activities in mental health to face the
health emergency generated by COVID-19 worldwide can include coordinated actions 
between workers, health teams and health institutions as part of a comprehensive,
community care, co-responsible and sustained over time.

A Space for Collaborative Creativity. How Collective Improvising Shapes 'a Sense 
of Belonging'.

In this contribution, we draw on findings from a non-formal, community music
project to elaborate on the relationship between the concept of eudaimonia, as
defined by Seligman, the interactive dimensions of collective free improvisation,
and the concept of collaborative creativity. The project revolves around The
Ostend Street Orkestra (TOSO), a music ensemble within which homeless adults and 
individuals with a psychiatric or alcohol/drug related background engage in
collective musical improvisation. Between 2017 and 2019 data was collected
through open interviews and video recordings of rehearsals and performances.
Participant data was analyzed through inductive analysis based on the principles 
of grounded theory. One interesting finding was the discrepancy in the
participant interviews between social relationships indicative of a negative
affect about social group interaction versus strong feelings of group coherence
and belonging. Video recordings of performances and rehearsals showed clear
enjoyment and pleasure while playing music. Alongside verbal reflection through
one-on-one interviews video recordings and analysis of moment-to moment
observations should be used, in order to capture the complexity of community
music projects with homeless people. The initial open coding was aligned with the
five elements of the PERMA model. Overall, we observed more focus on Relationship
(sense of belonging), Engagement (flow in rehearsals and performances) and
Meaning (belonging to something greater than yourself) and less on Positive
Emotion and Accomplishment (goal setting).

The coherence of autobiographical memories plays an important role in
psychological well-being, as borne out by recent studies. This study aimed to
advance this understanding by assessing whether coherence predicted depressive
symptoms over time in adults. Further, it aimed to specify mediators through
which this association might occur, namely psychological resources of self-esteem
self-efficacy, meaning in life, and optimism. A sample of 160 participants (M age
= 26.4, SD = 3.2, 58.1% women) completed surveys at three time-points spaced 1
week apart. The surveys contained measures of the perceived coherence of life
stories and autobiographical memories, psychological resources, and depressive
symptoms. The results of a path analysis model, controlling for depressive
symptoms at baseline, indicated that perceived causal coherence was the only
unique predictor of later depressive symptoms, and that this occurred through
positive self-concept, represented by self-esteem and self-efficacy. Limitations 
of the study include no examination of cultural background as a moderating factor
and the short time-intervals. Overall, the findings provide further evidence that
the perception of how events have unfolded and impacted on one's life and sense
of self is particularly important in mitigating depressive symptoms. It extends
on our understanding by showing this occurs through changes in self-concept.

BACKGROUND: Managers have an important role in the creation of workplace
conditions that prevent sick leave and lead to high performance. In Lean, the
assumption is that people are the source for continuous improvements. There is a 
need for more knowledge about what kind of leadership can help managers in a Lean
context to create workplace conditions for less sick leave and higher
performance.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine how productivity and rate of 
sick leave changed at a stainless wire manufacturing unit after implementing a
new leadership approach based on Sense of Coherence theory (SOC) and Lean
philosophy.
METHODS: In this case study, interventions coupled with productivity, quality and
sick leave evaluations through the company's key performance indicators were
performed. The follow-up was also based on narrative descriptions from the
management team in the course of four meetings during the intervention. Notes
were taken and analyzed regarding perceived outcomes of the intervention.
RESULTS: The results showed that leadership based on SOC and Lean philosophy is
positively correlated with productivity per worker, as was the amount of yearly
production that met the quality specifications. The amount of sick leave
decreased during the period of the intervention compared to before the
intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Changes in management contribute to productivity. Combining Lean
tools and Lean philosophy with the Sense of Coherence theory (SOC) as a base for 
leadership can influence productivity and decrease the rate of sick leave.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 crisis has radically changed the way people live and
work. While most studies have focused on prevailing negative consequences,
potential positive shifts in everyday life have received less attention. Thus, we
examined the actual and perceived overall impact of the COVID-19 crisis on work
and private life, and the consequences for mental well-being (MWB), and
self-rated health (SRH) in German and Swiss employees.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected via an online questionnaire from
2118 German and Swiss employees recruited through an online panel service
(18-65 years, working at least 20 h/week, various occupations). The sample
provides a good representation of the working population in both countries. Using
logistic regression, we analyzed how sociodemographic factors and self-reported
changes in work and private life routines were associated with participants'
perceived overall impact of the COVID-19 crisis on work and private life.
Moreover, we explored how the perceived impact and self-reported changes were
associated with MWB and SRH.
RESULTS: About 30% of employees reported that their work and private life had
worsened, whereas about 10% reported improvements in work and 13% in private
life. Mandatory short-time work was strongly associated with perceived negative
impact on work life, while work from home, particularly if experienced for the
first time, was strongly associated with a perceived positive impact on work
life. Concerning private life, younger age, living alone, reduction in leisure
time, and changes in quantity of caring duties were strongly associated with
perceived negative impact. In contrast, living with a partner or family,
short-time work, and increases in leisure time and caring duties were associated 
with perceived positive impact on private life. Perceived negative impact of the 
crisis on work and private life and mandatory short-time work were associated
with lower MWB and SRH. Moreover, perceived positive impact on private life and
an increase in leisure time were associated with higher MWB.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study show the differential impact of the
COVID-19 crisis on people's work and private life as well as the consequences for
MWB and SRH. This may inform target groups and situation-specific interventions
to ameliorate the crisis.

PURPOSE: To describe the findings of four patients (four eyes) with optic disc
melanocytoma (ODM), using multimodal imaging.
METHODS: Retrospective case series.
RESULTS: On ocular ultrasonography ODMs appeared as hyperechogenic lesions with
moderate-to-high internal reflectivity. On blue-light fundus autofluorescence,
ODMs showed total hypoautofluorescence, while, on infrared reflectance images
appeared as bright and well-marginated lesions. MultiColor composite images
showed reddish-brown lesions with well-defined margins. Swept-source optical
coherence tomography revealed elevated lesions covering the optic disc with an
irregular hyperreflective surface, dishomogeneous internal structure with
hyperreflective dots, and posterior shadowing. In all cases optical coherence
tomography angiography detected intratumoral blood vessels which were not
detectable with fluorescein angiography.
CONCLUSION: Multimodal imaging in ODM might be useful both at presentation,
increasing the diagnostic accuracy, and at follow-up, providing helpful details, 
that can help to rule out the possibility of malignant transformation and other
ocular complications.

Social Work with Environmental Migrants: Exploring the Scope for Spiritually
Sensitive Practice.

Pandya S.

This article reports a survey of social workers' (N = 1,204) views on the scope
for spiritually sensitive practice with environmental migrants. Results indicated
some variations in models, assessment methods, techniques, and intervention
goals. Social workers from North America and South America, females, Christians, 
and Hindus working with environmentally forced migrants, and with higher scores
on personal spirituality measures, favored the strengths perspective and model of
salutogenesis, spiritual life maps, and spiritual competencies open dialogue as
assessment methods; meditation and mindfulness as congruous techniques; and
intervention goals as comprehensibility-manageability-meaningfulness and positive
coping. Social workers from the Asia-Pacific and African regions, males, Muslims,
and Buddhists working with environmental emergency and environmentally induced
economic migrants, and with lower personal spirituality scores, preferred the
biopsychosocial model and transpersonal spectrum models, spiritual genograms and 
spiritual history assessment; techniques such as guided visualization, journal
keeping, physical disciplines, and active imagination; and goals of interventions
such as happiness and forgiveness.

Objectives: The objective of the present study was to investigate whether an
acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)-based web-intervention (Group 1,
CareACT), or a standardized rehabilitation in a rehabilitation center (Group 2)
was effective in enhancing the psychological well-being of family caregivers aged
60 and over compared to support provided by voluntary caregiver associations
(Group 3).Methods: Altogether, 149 family caregivers participated in this
quasi-experimental study. Primary outcome measure was depression. Secondary
outcomes included anxiety, sense of coherence, quality of life, psychological
flexibility, experiential avoidance, and thought suppression. The questionnaires 
were administered at baseline, and four, and 10 months post-measurement. We
investigated differences in the changes between the groups using Mplus modeling
techniques.Results: Regarding the main outcome of depression, the results suggest
that the CareACT intervention was superior to standardized rehabilitation and to 
the support given by caregiver associations at four months, both showing a
medium-sized difference between the groups. However, the change from four to
10 months post-intervention was not significantly different between these groups 
(d = 0.32-0.36). Thought suppression showed a significantly different change
between the three groups from baseline to four months and to 10 months
post-measurement (p = .038).Conclusions: Web-based ACT may have beneficial
effects on depressive symptoms and thought suppression in older
caregivers.Clinical implications: Web-based ACT could be a feasible alternative
to institutional rehabilitation and support provided by voluntary caregiver
associations. Web-based ACT responds flexibly to the needs of caregivers and
provides them an opportunity for learning new skills to promote well-being.

BACKGROUND: The impact of cancer diagnosis and treatment on sexual quality of
life (SQoL) is a well-established survivorship issue for gynaecological cancer
survivors (GCS), yet little is known on how to intervene.
PURPOSE: The aim of this systematic review was to identify the factors explaining
the variability in SQoL for GCS.
METHODS: We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework and the software Covidence. Electronic databases
Scopus, Web of Science, PUBMED and CINAHL were searched for original research on 
GCS published between 2002 and 2018. We performed a two-stage screening process
against selection criteria and quality assessment of individual studies. The
Salutogenic Theory and the PRECEDE-PROCEED model were used as theoretical
frameworks to identify and categorise factors.
RESULTS: The initial search yielded 3,505 articles resulting in a total of 46
studies used to examine the association between factors of SQoL and
gynaecological cancers. Our findings suggested that SQoL varies across subgroups 
based on age, menopausal status, relationship status, and treatment modality.
Protective factors included clinicians' knowledge and confidence, preventive
medical approach, risk and needs assessment, patient-clinician communication,
relationship quality, psychosocial support, symptom management, accessibility of 
psychosexual care, and self-efficacy in the rediscovery of sexuality.
CONCLUSION: Despite the high incidence and long-term impact of sexual health
issues on quality of life, supportive care needs are not being met. A better
understanding of the evidence base around the factors of SQoL can help health
professionals take steps to protect and improve SQoL in GCS.

AIMS: To analyse the relationship between work engagement, sense of coherence and
psychological distress levels in Spanish health professionals who were active
during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.
BACKGROUND: Work engagement and sense of coherence can help professionals to cope
with work-related psychological distress due to the harsh conditions of the
COVID-19 working environment.
METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study of 1,459 health care professionals. 
The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, the Sense of Coherence Scale and Goldberg's
General Health Questionnaire were distributed and analysed with descriptive and
multiple linear regression methods.
RESULTS: High levels of work engagement, especially in the dedication dimension, 
of sense of coherence, in particular in the meaningfulness dimension, and
psychological distress were obtained. Significant correlations (p < .001) were
identified between all the variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Work engagement and sense of coherence correlated positively with
each other and both negatively with psychological distress. So, health care
professionals, despite presenting psychological distress, perceive their work
satisfactorily and positively despite the severity of the situation and the harsh
conditions.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Sense of coherence and work engagement are
protective factors against psychological distress. Preventive measures for
professionals should go through the dimensionalization of the problem and the
adaptation of practical measures for daily management.

Current concepts on diffuse choroidal hemangioma in Sturge Weber syndrome.

Andrea Hospital, Rome, Italy.

Background: Diffuse choroidal hemangioma (DCH) is a benign vascular tumor that is
characteristically found in the Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). Recent genetic
discoveries demonstrate that DCH occurs sporadically from an activating mutation 
in GNAQ at codon R183. Mutations in GNAQ or GNA11 result in dysregulation of the 
mitogen-activated protein kinase, which influences gene transcription and results
in cellular proliferation. DCH may not always be readily detected on routine
ophthalmological examination, consequently diagnosis and multidisciplinary
referral are often delayed.Purpose: A literature search was performed through
April 2020 without a lower date limit. This review will summarize the
pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of DCH.Discussion: Multimodal imaging
facilitates early detection of the condition. In particular, enhanced depth
imaging spectral domain optical coherence tomography enables non-invasive,
high-resolution visualization of the choroid to even detect mild choroidal
thickening. Management of symptomatic DCH is generally difficult and results in
poor visual outcome, thus, treatment is generally unwarranted, unless the
hemangioma complicated by serous retinal detachment. The main treatment method is
radiation therapy with external beam radiation therapy, proton beam therapy,
plaque brachytherapy, and gamma knife surgery where low doses of radiation entail
fewer complications. One method of alternative management is with photodynamic
therapy that, although less invasive with a lower rate of complications, is not
always feasible or effective in cases with extensive exudative retinal
detachment.Conclusions: Multimodal ophthalmological imaging facilitates diagnosis
of DCH and lifelong surveillance is essential in patients.

AIMS: Hypertension (HTN) is a chronic long-term, slowly progressing disease. For 
HTN control, management, and prevention of associated complications, adequate
adherence to treatment is required. It has been proposed that tailored
interventions to individual needs are required to address the phenomenon of
adherence to treatment. However, studies evaluating the effects of tailored
interventions to improve adherence are still scarce. The aim of this study is to 
evaluate the effectiveness of a tailored intervention using a salutogenic
approach, to improve adherence in patients with HTN.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A non-randomized trial design was used in this study. Adult 
patients with HTN were allocated in two groups: tailored intervention (n = 75)
and standard care (n = 78). The content of the tailored intervention was based on
personal resources and elaboration of an action plan with objectives in agreement
with the patients. Patient outcomes (treatment adherence, blood pressure) were
assessed both at the beginning of the study and at the 4-week follow-up for the
intervention group and the standard care group. The Treatment Adherence
Questionnaire for Patients with Hypertension was used to measure adherence. The
results of this study showed that the total score and each dimension of the
adherence questionnaire (medications, diet, physical activity, weight control,
stimulation, and stress relief) increased significantly in the experimental group
compared with the control group (P < 0.05). For the group assigned to tailored
intervention, the delta score of the total adherence score increased in the final
evaluation to 9.4 (95% CI = 8.60-10.28).
CONCLUSION: A tailored intervention with a salutogenic approach appears to be
effective for improving adherence in patients with HTN. Randomized controlled
trials are required to confirm the effect of tailored interventions in this type 
of population.

BACKGROUND: Slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) requires
behavioral changes such as physical distancing (e.g., staying a 6-foot distance
from others, avoiding mass gatherings, reducing houseguests), wearing masks,
reducing trips to nonessential business establishments, and increasing hand
washing. Like other health behaviors, COVID-19 related behaviors may be related
to risk representations. Risk representations are the cognitive responses a
person holds about illness risk such as, identity (i.e., label/characteristics of
risk), cause (i.e., factors causing condition), timeline (i.e., onset/duration of
risk), consequences (i.e., intrapersonal/interpersonal outcomes), behavioral
efficacy (i.e., if and how the condition can be controlled/treated), and illness 
risk coherence (i.e., extent to which representations, behaviors, and beliefs are
congruent). The current study applies the Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation
(CSM-SR) to evaluate how risk representations may relate to COVID-19 protective
and risk behaviors.
METHODS: Participants include 400 workers from Amazon's Mechanical Turk aged
≥ 18 years and US residents. Participants completed an online survey measuring
risk representations (B-IPQ) and COVID-19 related behaviors, specifically,
physical distancing, hand washing, and shopping frequency.
RESULTS: Risk coherence, consequences, timeline, emotional representation, and
behavioral efficacy were related to risk and protective behaviors.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk representations vary in their relationship to COVID-19 risk and
protective behaviors. Implications include the importance of coherent, targeted, 
consistent health communication, and effective health policy in mitigating the
spread of COVID-19.

Studying the sense of agency in the absence of motor movement: an investigation
into temporal binding of tactile sensations and auditory effects.

People form coherent representations of goal-directed actions. Such agency
experiences of intentional action are reflected by a shift in temporal
perception: self-generated motor movements and subsequent sensory effects are
perceived to occur closer together in time-a phenomenon termed intentional
binding. Building on recent research suggesting that temporal binding occurs
without intentionally performing actions, we further examined whether such
perceptual compression occurs when motor action is fully absent. In three
experiments, we used a novel sensory-based adaptation of the Libet clock paradigm
to assess how a brief tactile sensation on the index finger and a resulting
auditory stimulus perceptually bind together in time. Findings revealed robust
temporal repulsion (instead of binding) between tactile sensation and auditory
effect. Temporal repulsion was attenuated when participants could anticipate the 
identity and temporal onset (two crucial components of intentional action) of the
tactile sensation. These findings are briefly discussed in the context of
differences between intentional movement and anticipated bodily sensations in
shaping action coherence and agentic experiences.

BACKGROUND: The theory of salutogenesis focuses on resources for health and
health-promoting processes. In the context of midwives' work, this is not well
described despite the importance for occupational health and the intention to
remain in the profession. In order to promote a healthy workplace, it is
necessary to consider the facilitating conditions that contribute to a
sustainable working life. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore
health-promoting facilitative conditions in the work situation on labour wards
according to midwives.
METHODS: A constant comparative analysis was applied to face-to-face interviews
with midwives that constituted the empirical material in this classical grounded 
theory study.
RESULTS: The substantive theory of Professional courage to create a pathway
within midwives' fields of work emerged as an explanation of the health-promoting
facilitative conditions in midwives' work situation. The theory consists of a
four-stage process with prerequisite contextual conditions: visualising
midwifery, organisational resources and a reflective and learning environment,
that were needed to fulfil the midwives' main concern a Feasibility of working as
a midwife. This meant being able to work according to best-known midwifery theory
and practice in each situation. Positive consequences of a fulfilled main concern
were a professional identity and grounded knowledge that enabled the development 
of the resistant resource professional courage. The courage made it feasible for 
midwives to move freely on their pathway within the different fields of work
extending between normal and medicalised birth and being autonomous and
regulated.
CONCLUSIONS: A professional courage was required to create a pathway within
midwives' fields of work, to move freely depending on what actions were needed in
a particular work situation. Professional courage could be seen as a resistance
resource, enabling midwives to become resilient when dealing with the
unpredictable work situation. However, there are vital organisational
preconditions that needed to be fulfilled for workplaces to become facilitative, 
organisational resources, visualising midwifery and a reflective environment. The
theory can be used to foster health-promoting and sustainable work situations for
midwives, which is possible if the organisational preconditions are met. This
could be a key factor in retaining midwives in the profession.

Introduction: Sexuality and intimacy in residential aged care (RAC) are receiving
increased research attention. In this article, porneia refers to access to sex
workers, as well as online pornography, and masturbation by residents in RAC. Sex
work is legal and regulated in Aotearoa New Zealand.
Methods: The present study was a two-arm mixed-method cross-sectional study using
a concurrent triangulation design. A validated survey tool was developed. Data
were collected in 2018-2019: 433 staff surveys were collected from 35 RAC across 
the country; 61 interviews were carried out with 77 staff, residents, and family 
members.
Results: Staff opinions about sex work and pornography were inconclusive.
Nevertheless, access to sex workers occurs in many RAC facilities across the
country. Interviews demonstrated a diversity of responses among the three groups;
staff attitudes are paramount.
Conclusions: Some staff are prepared for resident requests for sex workers;
others continue to look to policies and management for guidance, but such
policies are often lacking. Most staff have adopted the language of needs vs.
rights which dominates the literature.
Policy Implications: Staff education on sexuality and facility policy is
essential; education for residents and their families is also desirable.
Facilities often over-notify third parties. Discourse about sexuality needs to
move towards a person-centred, salutogenic approach.

The Digital Divide in the Era of COVID-19: An Investigation into an Important
Obstacle to the Access to the mHealth by the Citizen.

In general, during the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a growth in the use of
digital technological solutions in many sectors, from that of consumption, to
Digital Health and in particular to mobile health (mHealth) where an important
role has been played by mobile technology (mTech). However, this has not always
happened in a uniform way. In fact, in many cases, citizens found themselves
unable to take advantage of these opportunities due to the phenomenon of the
Digital Divide (DD). It depends on multifaceted aspects ranging from the lack of 
access to instrumental and network resources, to cultural and social barriers and
also to possible forms of communication disability. In the study we set ourselves
the articulated goal of developing a probing methodology that addresses the
problems connected to DD in a broad sense, capable of minimizing the bias of a
purely electronic submission and evaluating its effectiveness and outcome. At the
moment, we have submitted the survey both electronically (with an embedded
solution to spread it inside the families/acquaintances) and using the wire
phone. The results highlighted three polarities (a) the coherence of the two
methods; (b) the outcome of the entire submission in relation to key issues
(e.g., familiarity on contact tracing Apps, medical Apps, social Apps, messaging 
Apps, Digital-health, non-medical Apps); (c) a Digital Divide strongly dependent 
on age and in particular for the elderly is mainly evident in the use of mTech in
general and in particular in mHealth applications. Future developments of the
study foresee, after adequate data-mining, an in-depth study of all the aspects
proposed in the survey, from those relating to access to resources, training,
disability and other cultural factors.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to determine the validity and
reliability of the Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) for women during the postpartum
period. Methods: This is a validation study of a measurement instrument. This
study includes 212 women over the age of 19 who gave birth from March to
September 2019 in Maternal and Child Hospital of Jaén (Spain). The items of the
CSI were adapted for newborn care. Content validity was measured by five experts,
calculating the index of agreement (Aiken's V). Criterion validity was assessed
by correlations with scores of other tools that measure constructs related to
burden (Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Questionnaire,
SOC-13 and Duke-UNC-11). Construct validity was determined by the known-groups
method. Internal consistency was measured using Cronbach's Alpha, and stability
was analysed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).
RESULTS: Regarding content validity, an Aiken's V of 1.00 (p = 0.032) was
obtained. Regarding criterion validity, the correlation analyses showed
statistically significant coefficients between the scores of the questionnaire
and those of the sense of coherence (r = -0.447, p < 0.001), depressive symptoms 
(r = 0.429, p < 0.001), social support (rho = -0.379, p < 0.001) and anxiety
symptoms (r = 0.532, p < 0.001). The known-groups method showed statistically
significant differences in the mean of subjective burden between the groups
(depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, sense of coherence and social support).
The total scale obtained a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.710. The ICC was 0.979.
CONCLUSIONS: The adapted CSI is a valid and reliable screening tool for the
subjective burden in women during the puerperium. The adapted CSI can play an
important role as a guide to detect the subjective burden in women during the
puerperium.

Life Satisfaction and Adaptation in Persons with Parkinson's Disease-A
Qualitative Study.

Persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) need to adapt to their progressive
disability to achieve and maintain a high degree of life satisfaction (LS), but
little is known about the meaning of LS and adaptation. This study aimed to gain 
an in-depth understanding of the meaning of LS and adaptation in persons with PD.
Open-ended in-depth interviews were performed with 13 persons diagnosed with PD, 
9 women, 3 men, and one non-binary person (mean age 54 years, mean time since
diagnosis 3.4 years). The interviews were analyzed using a
phenomenological-hermeneutic approach. The participants were in the process of
adapting to their new health situation. There were two quite distinct groups: one
that adapted through acceptance and one that struggled to resist the disease and 
the profound impact it had on their lives. The thematic structural analysis
covers eight themes illustrating the meaning of LS and adaptation, through either
acceptance or resistance. Adaptation to PD involves a transitional process
characterized by either acceptance or resistance, which influences a person's LS.
Acceptance makes LS possible, whereas resistance constitutes a behavioral barrier
to adaptation and LS. Rehabilitation professionals need to understand this
individual process to be able to support a person with PD to reach and maintain a
high level of LS. Understanding the link between LS and adaptation can support
rehabilitation professionals to provide targeted interventions for people with
PD.

Blue spaces have been found to have significant salutogenic effects. However,
little is known about the mechanisms and pathways that link blue spaces and
health. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to summarise
the evidence and quantify the effect of blue spaces on four hypothesised
mediating pathways: physical activity, restoration, social interaction and
environmental factors. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a literature search was
conducted using six databases (PubMed, Scopus, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Cochrane
Library, EBSCOHOST/CINAHL). Fifty studies were included in our systematic review.
The overall quality of the included articles, evaluated with the Qualsyst tool,
was judged to be very good, as no mediating pathway had an average article
quality lower than 70%. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for physical 
activity, restoration and social interaction. Living closer to blue space was
associated with statistically significantly higher physical activity levels
(Cohen's d = 0.122, 95% CI: 0.065, 0.179). Shorter distance to blue space was not
associated with restoration (Cohen's d = 0.123, 95% CI: -0.037, 0.284) or social 
interaction (Cohen's d = -0.214, 95% CI: -0.55, 0.122). Larger amounts of blue
space within a geographical area were significantly associated with higher
physical activity levels (Cohen's d = 0.144, 95% CI: 0.024, 0.264) and higher
levels of restoration (Cohen's d = 0.339, 95% CI: 0.072, 0.606). Being in more
contact with blue space was significantly associated with higher levels of
restoration (Cohen's d = 0.191, 95% CI: 0.084, 0.298). There is also evidence
that blue spaces improve environmental factors, but more studies are necessary
for meta-analyses to be conducted. Evidence is conflicting on the mediating
effects of social interaction and further research is required on this
hypothesised pathway. Blue spaces may offer part of a solution to public health
concerns faced by growing global urban populations.

Sense of coherence (SOC) is a psychological factor that contributes to mental
health maintenance under stressful environment. Likewise, level of SOC might
affect mental health among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic
differently. In this study, we investigated the relationships between lifestyle
changes and mental health (General Health Questionnaire-12: GHQ-12) among
different level of SOC (weak, moderate, or strong by SOC-13). The data of 898
healthcare workers from cross-sectional survey dataset were extracted and
analyzed. As results, based on GHQ-12 score, 86.1% of 244 participants with weak 
SOC, 60.1% of 606 participants with moderate SOC, and 31.3% of 48 participants
with strong SOC had poor mental health. Both SOC levels and lifestyle changes
(except alcohol consumption) had significant main effects on the GHQ-12 score.
Analysis on the association between lifestyle changes and mental health status
stratified by SOC level reveled that among participants with weak SOC, those who 
increased their leisure and activity time had reduced odds of poor mental health 
than those who made no changes (OR: 0.08, CI: 0.01 to 0.64). Healthcare workers
with weak SOC were at risk of poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic,
and lifestyle changes may improve their mental health.

How does stress affect life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic? Moderated 
mediation analysis of sense of coherence and fear of coronavirus.

Opole University, Opole, Poland.

The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between fear of
COVID-19, stress, sense of coherence, and life satisfaction during the
coronavirus pandemic. Participants were 907 Polish people (522 women and 385
men). We used the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Fear of COVID-19 Scale
(FOC-6), Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-29) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. 
The relationship between stress and life satisfaction was mediated by the sense
of coherence, and the relationship between stress and sense of coherence was
moderated by fear of COVID-19. The fear of COVID-19 acted as a buffer in the
relationship between stress and sense of coherence weakening the impact of stress
on the sense of coherence. This study is the first to verify the proposed model
of moderated mediation during the COVID-19 pandemic and was undertaken in a very 
large sample. This manuscript highlights the important role of the fear of
COVID-19 and sense of coherence in our well-being. An individual's sense of
coherence can affect their subjective well-being and help them to effectively
manage stress and reduce anxiety.

During crises (major events characterised by uncertainty, urgency and threat),
society must make sense of rapidly unfolding events. This happens mainly through 
narrativising-depicting a setting, characters and a meaningful sequence of events
and actions unfolding over time. In the early months of the pandemic, UK general 
practice shifted from face-to-face consultations to a remote-by-default model
(telephone, video or e-consultation). This shift was initially widely accepted by
press and public, but support waned after a politician declared that the change
would be permanent. We invoke Burke's dramatistic pentad of act, scene, agent,
agency and purpose to theorise findings from a detailed analysis of media
coverage of the remote-by-default policy and reactions to it. We consider the 12 
weeks from March to June 2020 (first lockdown, when remote-by-default services
had just been introduced) and 1 week from late July 2020 (following the
ministerial announcement). The initial introduction of remote consulting had
strong narrative coherence in which all parts of the pentad were balanced: scene 
(a deadly virus threatening the country) aligned with act (lockdown, including
avoiding face-to-face appointments unless essential), agents (the National Health
Service and digital technology as heroic macro-actors), agency (general
practitioners 'deployed') and purpose (to control the pandemic). The later
period, however, was characterised by a mismatch between scene (a country
emerging from lockdown and resuming normal life), act (imposition of the remote
model), agent (a politician known for his enthusiasm for technology), agency
(top-down directive) and purpose (modernisation). Whereas media narratives in the
first period aligned with the genre of heroic adventure (suggesting a worthy
battle, bravely fought), those of the second had characteristics of farce
(something both comic and grotesque). We conclude that close reading of media
narratives may surface potential misalignments between policy decisions and the
context in which they must be implemented.

The increase in the elderly population in need of healthcare services has led to 
a serious shortage in the nursing workforce. To retain a large nursing workforce,
a strong work-life balance among nurses is needed along with a healthy work
environment. This prospective study investigates the influence of work-life
balance and sense of coherence on intention to leave among hospital nurses. A
questionnaire survey was conducted with 2239 nurses as a baseline. The
explanatory variables included striving for work-life balance behavior, a sense
of coherence in terms of personal resources, and work-, organizational-, and
individual-related factors. Using a cohort of 1368 valid responses, we measured
intention to leave among 975 nurses with whom we were able to follow up 6 months 
after the baseline survey. We then performed multiple regression analysis. The
behavior striving for work-life balance was shown to influence nurses' intention 
to leave. Nurses who exhibited less striving for work-life balance behavior
showed higher intentions to leave. The sense of coherence was not identified as a
factor affecting intention to leave. Securing a comfortable work-life balance
would reduce the nurses' desire to quit the hospital. To reduce nurse turnover,
nurse managers should develop support programs that can help nurses achieve a
better work-life balance.

Purpose: Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive and
objective tool for the evaluation of the retinal microvascular changes in Fabry
disease (FD). We investigated changes in retinal vasculature in FD patients, and 
the possible correlation with systemic parameters, by using OCTA, and reviewed
the current status of literature. Methods: Thirteen FD patients (eight females,
five males, mean age 49.85 ± 14.7 years) were compared with 13 age- and
sex-matched healthy controls. OCTA 3 × 3 mm macular scans were performed in all
subjects. We evaluated the vessel density and vessel perfusion in distinct
macular areas (whole, inner, and outer) of both the superficial capillary plexus 
(SCP VD and SCP VP) and of the deep capillary plexus (DCP VD and DCP VP). We also
evaluated the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) metrics (area, perimeter, and
circularity), and correlation between systemic and OCTA parameters. A literature 
review on the current understanding of OCTA in FD is then presented. Results: FD 
patients showed significantly lower SCP VD values in the whole area (17.37 ± 2.08
mm-1 vs. 18.54 ± 1.21 mm-1; p-value 0.022), as well as in the outer area (17.46 ±
2.10 mm-1 vs. 19.08 ± 1.14 mm-1; p-value 0.002), but not in the inner. Even the
DCP VD was significantly lower in all the imaged areas: whole (17.75 ± 3.93 mm-1 
vs. 19.71 ± 1.20 mm-1; p-value 0.024), outer (18.25 ± 4.17 mm-1 vs. 20.33 ± 1.20 
mm-1; p-value 0.023), and inner (19.54 ± 4.17 mm-1 vs. 21.96 ± 1.55 mm-1; p-value
0.011). There were no significant differences in vessel perfusion parameters
(both SCP VP and DCP VP ones) and FAZ. No significant correlations were found
between the OCTA parameters and systemic parameters (maximal left ventricular
wall thickness and glomerular filtration rate) in FD patients. Conclusions: OCTA 
can be considered as a promising non-invasive tool, which enables a quantitative 
evaluation of retinal vascular involvement in FD, despite the varying data
reported in literature. Our results support the use of OCTA as an objective tool 
to evaluate retinal vascular abnormalities in FD. The utility of OCTA in FD needs
to be validated by longitudinal studies taking into account the overall
progression of the disease.

National service systems in child healthcare are characterized by diversity and
complexity. Primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary healthcare services
create complex networks covering pediatric subspecialties, psychology, sociology,
economics and politics. Can pediatrics exist without philosophy? Does the absence
of integrating philosophical perspectives during conceptualization of pediatric
care contribute to deficiencies in the service systems structuring child
healthcare? Philosophy offers new ways of complex systems thinking in scientific 
and clinical pediatrics. Philosophy could improve coping strategies on different 
levels when dealing with ethics of research projects, individual child healthcare
and crises of healthcare service systems. Boundary and ultimate situations
experienced by severely sick children require help, hope and resilience. Patients
and families as well as pediatricians and other caregivers must act in concert.
All of them may benefit from consulting with philosophers. The aim of this
article is to point out the risks of a strict separation of scientific insight
and sensory experience affecting child healthcare in our modern society, which is
dominated by technology, competition and lack of equity and time.

We examined sixth graders' detection of inconsistencies in narrative and
expository passages, contrasting participants who were monolingual speakers (N = 
85) or Spanish-English DLLs (N = 94) when recruited in pre-kindergarten (PK). We 
recorded self-paced reading times and judgments about whether the text made
sense, and took an independent measure of word reading. Main findings were that
inconsistency detection was better for narratives, for participants who were
monolingual speakers in PK, and for those who were better word readers. When the 
text processing demands were increased by separating the inconsistent sentence
and its premise with filler sentences there was a stronger signal for
inconsistency detection during reading for better word readers. Reading patterns 
differed for texts for which children reported an inconsistency compared to those
for which they did not, indicating a failure to adequately monitor for coherence 
while reading. Our performance measures indicate that narrative and expository
texts make different demands on readers.

This is a report about the experience on redefining the health asset mapping
methodology. The aim of this experience consisted of making an analysis on health
inequalities, as well as of using it as a tool in decision-making participative
processes in the local administration area. Thus, a replicable procedure for all 
ages and groups was designed. Besides this, assets have been widely classified,
in accordance with the territorial distribution, people's profiles and asset
features. Both the upload of data to a geographical information system and the
large amount of data gathered allowed us to enlarge the common interpretation of 
data and present the information in a dynamic way.

This paper intends to raise the potential interest that the principles and
experiences of the so-called behavioral economy have in the field of public
health and, more specifically, in behavioral changes, thus substituting harmful
behaviors to health for salutogenic behaviors while respecting the final freedom 
of choice of the person. In this article, we review the foundations of behavioral
economics, emphasizing the work of Tversky and Kahneman and their approach to
prospective theory and the role of brain activity levels 1 (automatic) and 2
(reflective) in decision making process. On the basis of these approaches, Thaler
and Sustein identify a series of biases that will be used as tools to facilitate 
behavioral changes through a set of actions "that modify people's behavior in a
predictable way without prohibiting any option or significantly changing their
economic incentives" based on the so-called libertarian paternalism. We review
its interest in public health, citing some empirical studies that demonstrate its
high level of effectiveness and efficiency, reflected in the creation of Nudge
Units in various countries, and concluding that this can be an interesting tool
to add (not to replace) the classical techniques of health promotion and disease 
prevention.

Publisher: Se pretende plantear el potencial interés que los principios y
experiencias de la denominada economía conductual tienen en el terreno de la
salud pública y, más concretamente, en los cambios conductuales, substituyendo
conductas nocivas para la salud por conductas salutogénicas, respetando la
libertad final de elección de la persona. En el artículo revisamos las bases de
la economía conductual, haciendo hincapié en los trabajos de Tversky y Kahneman, 
con su planteamiento de la teoría prospectiva y el rol de los niveles de
actividad cerebral 1 (automático) y 2 (reflexivo) en la toma de decisiones. A
partir de estos planteamientos Thaler y Sustein identifican una serie de sesgos
que serán utilizados como herramientas para facilitar los cambios conductuales
mediante un conjunto de actuaciones “que modifican la conducta de las personas de
una manera predecible sin prohibir ninguna opción ni cambiar de forma
significativa sus incentivos económicos” basándose en el denominado paternalismo 
libertario. Revisamos su interés en salud pública, citando algunos estudios

The aim of the study was to compare the strategies of coping with stress during
the COVID-19 epidemic in athletes involved in Olympic preparations (57 potential 
Olympians) and students of physical education (54 extramural students), and to
determine their depending on the variable gender. The research was conducted in
the form of an on-line survey in the period of April 7-28 during the COVID-19
pandemic. Four standard psychological questionnaires were used. Elite athletes
and physical education students practicing sports most often dealt with the
stress of the COVID-19 pandemic using cognitive and behavioral coping strategies.
The sports level depended on the strategies of coping with the stress of the
COVID-19 pandemic more strongly than gender. The relationship between the sense
of coherence (mainly comprehensibility) and the hope for success treated as a
generalized immune resource with coping strategies in the case of the COVID-19
pandemic postulated by Antonovsky was confirmed.

BACKGROUND: Social Prescribing is increasingly popular, and several evaluations
have shown positive results. However, Social Prescribing is an umbrella term that
covers many different interventions. We aimed to test, develop and refine a
programme theory explaining the underlying mechanisms operating in Social
Prescribing to better enhance its effectiveness by allowing it to be targeted to 
those who will benefit most, when they will benefit most.
METHODS: We conducted a realist evaluation of a large Social Prescribing
organisation in the North of England. Thirty-five interviews were conducted with 
stakeholders (clients attending Social Prescribing, Social Prescribing staff and 
general practice staff). Through an iterative process of analysis, a series of
context-mechanism-outcome configurations were developed, refined and retested at 
a workshop of 15 stakeholders. The initial programme theory was refined, retested
and 'applied' to wider theory.
RESULTS: Social Prescribing in this organisation was found to be only
superficially similar to collaborative care. A complex web of contexts,
mechanisms and outcomes for its clients are described. Key elements influencing
outcomes described by stakeholders included social isolation and wider
determinants of health; poor interagency communication for people with multiple
needs. Successful Social Prescribing requires a non-stigmatising environment and 
person-centred care, and shares many features described by the asset-based theory
of Salutogenesis.
CONCLUSIONS: The Social Prescribing model studied is holistic and person-centred 
and as such enables those with a weak sense of coherence to strengthen this,
access resistance resources, and move in a health promoting or salutogenic
direction.

Autobiographical Meaning Making Protects the Sense of Self-Continuity Past Forced
Migration.

Emirates.

Forced migration changes people's lives and their sense of self-continuity
fundamentally. One memory-based mechanism to protect the sense of self-continuity
and psychological well-being is autobiographical meaning making, enabling
individuals to explain change in personality and life by connecting personal
experiences and other distant parts of life to the self and its development.
Aiming to replicate and extend prior research, the current study investigated
whether autobiographical meaning making has the potential to support the sense of
self-continuity in refugees. We therefore collected life narratives from 31
refugees that were coded for autobiographical reasoning, self-event connections, 
and global narrative coherence. In line with prior research, results suggest that
autobiographical meaning making relates to a higher sense of self-continuity and 
less psychological distress. Yet, if refugees experienced many continuing
postdisplacement stressors in addition to their forced displacement,
autobiographical meaning making was associated with higher self-discontinuity and
greater psychological distress, especially with trauma-related symptoms such as
memory intrusion and hyperarousal. Altogether, results indicate that
autobiographical meaning making helps to compensate the effects of extreme
biographical disruptions on the sense of self-continuity, as long as the stress
caused by the biographical change is not overwhelming or too protracted.

International research collaborators conducted research investigating
sociocultural responses to the Covid-19 pandemic. Our mixed methods research
design includes surveys and interviews conducted between March and September of
2020 including 249 of 506 survey responses and 18 of 50 in-depth, exploratory,
semi-structured interviews with self-defined politically left-leaning women in
the United States. We employ a sequential design to analyze statistical and
qualitative data. Despite international data suggesting that trust in federal
governments reduces anxiety, women who did not trust and actively opposed the
Trump administration reported lower levels of anxiety than expected. Results
indicate reliance on and development of new forms of connection that seem to
mitigate symptomatic anxieties when living in opposition. Women living in
opposition to the leadership of the federal government use and develop resources 
to help them cope. Research on coping strategies and mental health and anxiety
during crisis can inform recommendations for ways to support and strengthen sense
of coherence during tumultuous times.

Objective: Loneliness is the subjective distress of feeling alone and has a
strong impact on wellbeing and health. In addition to well-known predictors like 
isolation and poor health, a better understanding of the psychological
determinants of loneliness would offer effective targets for future complementary
interventions. Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study (N = 2,240), 
we compared the explanatory power of several important risk factors of loneliness
with the affective, motivational, and cognitive aspects of the Meaning in Life
(MiL) construct. Different nested linear models were compared including
socio-demographic, lifestyles, social-connectedness, and self-rated health
variables, to assess the overlapping and non-overlapping explanatory power of
each of them. Results: Health status and MiL were found to be the most important 
predictors of loneliness, followed by social connectedness and, with a much lower
weight, lifestyles, and socio-demographic factors. Within the MiL factor, the
most cognitive component, sense of coherence, had a greater explanatory power
than the more affective and motivational ones. Conclusion: Reduced MiL, the
capacity of an individual to attach "value and significance" to life, is a
crucial predictor to the feeling of loneliness. These results suggest that
programs aiming to combat loneliness should go well beyond situational
interventions and include more cognitive, value-centered interventions that
enable individuals to define and pursue a meaningful vital plan.

University, 103 Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, Republic of Korea.

BACKGROUND: Ninety-five percent of nursing graduate students in South Korea are
women, and most are often engaged in both academic coursework and work outside of
the academic environment. Nursing graduate students often experience stress
leading to physical and mental health problems that negatively affect their
academic performance and persistence during graduate programs. The purpose of
this study was to test multiple mediation effects of sense of coherence (SOC) and
social support in the relationship between stress and health status of nursing
graduate students.
METHODS: The participants of this study were 231 female nursing graduate students
from 14 universities. Data were collected using an online survey conducted
between August and October 2019. Bootstrap techniques using the PROCESS macro for
SPSS software were applied to assess the multi-mediating effects.
RESULTS: The total effect (B = - 12.29, p < .001) and direct effect (B = - 7.07, 
p < .001) of perceived stress on health status were significant. Perceived stress
had negative direct effects on social support (B = - 0.41, p < .001) and SOC
(B = - 5.77, p < .001). SOC had a positive direct effect on health status
(B = 0.59, p < .001). However, social support was not a significant predictor of 
health status (B = 1.24, p = .232). In addition, there was a positive direct
effect of social support on SOC (B = 5.23, p < .001). Furthermore, the indirect
effect of perceived stress on health status through SOC was significant
(B = - 3.42, 95% CI = - 5.2616, - 1.8906). There was also a significant indirect 
effect of perceived stress on health status through social support and SOC
(B = - 1.28, 95% CI = - 2.1663, - 0.5992).
CONCLUSION: It is necessary to create strategies that enhance nursing graduate
students' SOC and social support to reduce their perceived stress and to improve 
their health status.

Background: Little is known about how younger schoolchildren in a rural setting
experience their sense of coherence (SOC), how they think and reason about health
and what they perceive as important to achieve health goals. This study aimed to 
investigate children's SOC and their health perceptions.Method: In this
mixed-method study 94 children (8-12 years) from three rural schools answered
several questionnaires: The Child-SOC (CSOC), Positive Health Scale (PHS) and
Cantril's ladder of life scale. Another 23 children (of 94) participated in four 
focus group interviews. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes from the
interview transcripts.Results: High SOC was reported by 48% of the boys and 22%
of the girls. However, no significant gender differences were found. Four themes 
were generated from the qualitative analysis: Understanding health, Managing
health, Doing bodily health and Socialising health. Both younger and older
children had a holistic view of health in which health was seen as an
individual's living habits in which social contacts mattered.Conclusion: In a
rural context children need to adapt to activities that exist in their immediate 
environment. Thus, activities during school hours can be an important complement 
in health promotion.

and Management, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.

The aim of this study was to explore the coping resources of hope and sense of
coherence, which are rooted in positive-psychology theory, as potential
resilience factors that might reduce the emotional distress experienced by adults
from three cultural groups in Israel during the chronic-stress situation of a
pandemic. The three cultural groups examined were secular Jews, Ultra-Orthodox
Jews, and Arabs. We compared these cultural groups during the second wave of the 
Covid-19 pandemic, just before the Jewish New Year (mid-September 2020) as a
second lockdown was announced. Data were gathered from 248 secular Jews, 243
Ultra-Orthodox Jews, and 203 Arabs, who were 18-70 years old (M = 37.14, SD =
12.62). The participants filled out self-reported questionnaires including the
Brief Symptom Inventory as a measure of emotional/psychological distress (i.e.,
somatization, depression, and anxiety) and questionnaires about sense of
coherence and different types of hope (i.e., intrapersonal, interpersonal, and
transpersonal) as measures of coping resources and resiliency. Differences were
found between the three groups in terms of several variables. The Arab
participants reported the highest levels of emotional distress and the lowest
levels of interpersonal and transpersonal hope; whereas the Ultra-Orthodox
participants revealed the highest levels of sense of coherence and other
resilience factors. A structural equation model revealed that, in addition to the
sociodemographic factors, only sense of coherence and intrapersonal hope played
significant roles in explaining emotional distress, explaining 60% of the
reported distress among secular Jews, 41% among Ultra-Orthodox Jews, and 48%
among Arabs. We discuss our findings in light of the salutogenic and hope
theories. We will also discuss their relevancy to meaning-seeking and
self-transcendence theory in the three cultural groups.

[Development and testing of reliability and validity of a subjective QOL scale
for older adults perceiving a dynamic healthy life through the three dimensions
of biological life, everyday life, and overall course of life].

Objectives　To develop and assess the reliability and validity of a scale
measuring subjective quality of life (QOL), which encompasses the "strength and
ability" to live positively through the three dimensions of biological life,
everyday life, and overall course of life, in order to support QOL in older
adults.Methods　We reviewed related literature and conducted interviews with
patients with chronic diseases. Participants rated their QOL on a seven-point
scale using the visual analog scale. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were
used to collect data from 100 older adults living in their own homes. The
participants were between the ages of 70 and 84, and were recruited from
comprehensive community support centers or from among hospital outpatients. We
assessed scale reliability using Cronbach's α, item-total (I-T) correlation
analysis, and calculation of α coefficient-if-item-deleted. We examined content
validity by analyzing the content of the free response items. To evaluate
construct validity, we carried out a hierarchical multiple regression analysis,
examined the semantic content of the factors related to subjective QOL, and
confirmed consistency with previous studies.Results　Regarding the reliability
analysis of the scale, the α coefficient was 0.898, and both the I-T correlation 
and α coefficient-if-item-deleted exceeded the minimum value considered reliable.
In examining content validity, the categories extracted for each of the three
dimensions were found to demonstrate the characteristics of the general ideas of 
each dimension of QOL. Thus, the scale was confirmed to have overall content
validity. As for the assessment of validity of its constitutive concepts,
subjective QOL scores were significantly high among participants who had jobs,
had role-related or financial capacity, used two or more nursing services, or
scored high in perceived health competence, social networking, and sense of
coherence (SOC). In addition, "meaningfulness" of SOC, and financial capacity had
significant correlations with subjective QOL. These results are consistent with
past research and therefore confirm construct validity.Conclusion　This study
sufficiently confirmed the reliability and validity of the scale, and
consequently its usability.

Impact of Parents' Sense of Coherence on Children's Oral Health-Related Behaviors
and Dental Caries Experience among Newcomers.

Elyasi M, Abtahi M, Kornerup I, Amin M.

PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between parents' sense of coherence (SOC)
and children's oral health outcomes among newcomers (immigrants to Canada).
METHODS: Immigrant parents with children aged 1-12 years who lived in Canada for 
10 years or less were recruited. Outcome variables included children's caries
experience (DMFT/dmft) and oral health-related behaviors (frequency of
toothbrushing, sugar intake, and dental visits). Parents SOC was measured.
RESULTS: Among 274 parents: mean (SD) age 34.92 (6.35) years; 57% post-secondary 
education; 38% monthly income below $2000; and 41% living in Canada for less than
five years. Children: mean (SD) age 4.5 (2.9) years; 55% born in Canada; 42%
dental coverage; 52% untreated caries. The mean (SD) of parents' SOC was 59.1
(12.03). Sense of coherence scores were not significantly associated with
children's caries experience and oral health behaviors.
CONCLUSIONS: Parent's SOC was relatively low among newcomers and not associated
with children's oral health outcomes.

This study aimed to investigate the status of sense of coherence (SOC),
acceptance of disability (AD) and psychological distress (PD) of patients with
permanent colostomy and evaluate the role of AD in mediating the relationship
between SOC and PD. Cross-sectional data were collected from 162 patients with
permanent colostomy at stoma care outpatient clinic. Structural Equation Model of
the SOC, AD, and PD was established to examine the mediating effect. Results
indicated that the SOC and AD of patients with permanent colostomy were both at a
low level, and PD was common in patients. In addition, a partial mediating effect
of AD between SOC and PD was verified. Enhancing the SOC and AD of patients with 
permanent colostomy could be essential for alleviating their PD.

Community crises require the provision of short-term reflective intervention
methods to help service users identify stressors, and access and intensify their 
adaptive coping. Here, we demonstrate the use of a single-session online
cognitive behavioral- and art-based (CB-ART) intervention within the context of
the COVID-19 pandemic. In this method, the individual draws three images: his/her
COVID-19-related stress, his/her perceived resources, and an integration of
stress and resources. This method provided a reflective space in which
individuals could identify their experienced stressors, acknowledge their coping 
resources, and integrate these two elements within the context of the current
pandemic. In this article, we use illustrative examples from a study implemented 
during the first national lockdown in Israel and present a tool that can be
easily implemented by mental-health professionals in ongoing community crises.
The aims of this intervention were to co-create knowledge with service users,
access their self-defined needs and strengths, and enhance their coping by
enabling them to view stress and coping as part of the salutogenic continuum.

Health-Related Social and Ethical Considerations towards the Utilization of
Dental Medical Services by Seniors: Influencing and Protective Factors,
Vulnerability, Resilience and Sense of Coherence.

Medicine, University of Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland.

The aim is to analyze protective and modifying factors (e.g., vulnerability,
resilience, sense of coherence) in relation to the utilization of dental services
by seniors at different levels of the healthcare system. Terminological
imprecision in the use and transfer of existing terms (sense of coherence,
resilience, salutogenesis) to gerodontology is clarified. Factors influencing a
reduced utilization (static/dynamic factors) can occur isolated or in combination
and, thus, model the risk of a reduced utilization of dental services
(influencing-factor mechanism). Protective factors of utilization include
patient-specific factors for self-motivation and factors that promote
oral-health-related resilience. Resistance forces that counteract can be
identified as oral-health-related resilience factors. Achieving social and
individual appreciation and establishing a prevention-oriented approach to
utilization will be increasingly challenging, since the population is becoming
older and access is not equal in terms of opportunity. Resistance forces need to 
be strengthened in an ethical context. Studies should increasingly present
resilience processes, determinants and modes of action at the various interfaces 
in the healthcare system, which can ensure sustainable medical care in old age.
The concepts conveyed here are generally valid and able to point out inequalities
and ageism in access to dental services.

In the articulation between research and health intervention, we see the need to 
situate comprehensive sexuality education in the triangle formed by the
salutogenic approach, the mainstreaming of gender and human rights, and the
development of competencies in health promotion. For this purpose, we present a
set of investigations carried out in Ecuador and Spain through a qualitative
methodology with the respective health interventions that seek to obtain
significant results of the teaching-learning process on sexuality. The field work
contemplates situations of violence as a health problem, orienting the
intervention in health empowerment toward pleasure. The health education
experiences implemented allow us to conclude that comprehensive sexuality
education reinforces the competencies of health personnel to attend to diversity.
These findings, and the results expected in ongoing research, allow us to form a 
competency framework aimed at specifically improving medical education so that
medical professionals can generate health processes with a cross-cutting approach
to gender and human rights.

Healthy eating can be challenging for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.
The theory of salutogenesis, which focuses on the resources required to organize 
behavioural changes in everyday life, was used to develop an intervention for
healthy eating. The aim was to describe the development, structure and content of
this salutogenic intervention. The development consisted of two phases that were 
based on the operationalization of important key principles of salutogenesis. In 
Phase 1 (Exploration and synthesis), a systematic review and three qualitative
studies were performed to explore important characteristics to enable healthy
eating in everyday life. The results were used to develop the draft intervention.
In Phase 2 (Validation and adjustment), interviews and workshops were conducted
with T2DM patients, healthcare providers and scientists. Based on this, the draft
intervention was modified into its final form. The developmental process resulted
in a 12-week, group-based intervention that aimed to enable important resources
for healthy eating via self-examination, reflection, setting goals and sharing
experiences. Attention was also paid to disease information, disease acceptance, 
food literacy, stress management, self-identity and social support. The group
sessions began following an individual intake session, with a booster session
held 3 months after the intervention. The researcher's translation of the
stakeholders' priorities into an intervention was corrected for and approved by
the stakeholders concerned. This comprehensive salutogenic intervention was
developed based on practical and scientific evidence. Providing transparency in
developmental processes and content is important because it determines the
scientific integrity and credibility of an intervention.

plain-language-summary: Healthy eating can be difficult for people with the
disease type 2 diabetes. This article describes how a programme aimed at helping 
type 2 diabetes patients to eat healthily was developed. The draft version of the
programme was based on a theoretical framework that aims to understand what
creates health in everyday life, and on conversations with type 2 diabetes
patients and healthcare providers. The draft programme was adjusted based on the 
feedback of type 2 diabetes patients, healthcare providers and scientists. This
resulted in a 12-week, group-based programme that enables people to think about
who they are and what they want by setting health goals and sharing experiences. 
Attention was also paid to disease knowledge, disease acceptance, nutritional
skills, dealing with stress, self-identity and social support. The group sessions
began following an individual intake session, with a booster session held 3
months after the intervention. By involving everybody, we were able to develop a 
programme that takes into account the preferences, needs and priorities of all
stakeholders. It is important to describe the development and the content of
programmes encouraging healthy eating to determine their quality and effectivity.

Self-management is essential for patients who require regular hemodialysis
treatment. This study aimed to explore the relationships between social support, 
sense of coherence (SOC), and self-management in hemodialysis patients and to
examine whether SOC plays a mediating role. In a cross-sectional study, 402
hemodialysis patients from four tertiary hospitals were recruited. Data were
analyzed using structural equation modeling. Social support, SOC, and
self-management were significantly correlated with each other. The proposed model
provided a good fit to the data. Social support had a direct effect on
self-management and SOC, partially mediated the effect of social support on
self-management (β = 0.248, p = 0.001). Social support and SOC explained 69% of
the variance in self-management. Our findings indicate that health care providers
can enhance social support with an emphasis on strengthening SOC strategies to
better improve self-management in hemodialysis patients.

BACKGROUND: A broad range of studies show that medical students often have a
significantly deteriorated mental health status. Although starting medical school
with values comparable to the population average, only a few semesters later,
medical undergraduates show increased rates of psychological risk states and some
manifest mental illnesses, such as burnout and depression. In our survey we
intentionally assessed mental health parameters from a salutogenetic, i.e.
resource-oriented point of view.
METHODS: We examined first-year medical students in a cross-sectional study and
assessed sense of coherence (SOC) and resilience as parameters from the
salutogenesis model by Antonovsky in a structured way using validated,
self-administered questionnaires. In total, we examined 236 students of human
medicine, dentistry and molecular medicine at the Friedrich-Alexander-University 
Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU).
RESULTS: Our analyses showed significantly higher values of resilience among male
students compared to female students (p < 0.01). In contrast, even though a
significant correlation between resilience and SOC was observed, only a
non-significantly lower value of SOC was found in female students. Compared to
the reference sample our medical students in their first year of study showed
significantly lower values for resilience (p < 0.01) and SOC (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Resilience and SOC are known to correlate with psychological stress
(burnout parameters) and depression. In order to keep protective factors like SOC
and resilience in medical students at a good and healthy level we see the
necessity to address that problem proactively and educationally. Integrating
training focused on the preservation of the students´ own mental health into the 
medical curriculum from the beginning of university courses, and throughout the
whole medical study course, is essential and should be an obligatory training
goal. Based on our study results, we also deem it necessary to think about ways
to adapt the measures for the gender-specific needs of our students, e.g.
dependent on their biological gender.

[The vaccine-condition or vaccination passport and its eventual fit into a broad 
recommended vaccination framework against COVID-19].

[Article in Spanish]

It is important to think about the eventual application of a COVID-19 vaccination
certificate as an eligibility criterion to carry out certain activities and to
discuss in advance the problems that the use of this tool may pose in legal
terms. To this end, we must begin by stating the assumptions that would be
necessary to justify its implantation, including scientific consensus on the
scope of the immunity granted by COVID-19 vaccines, especially in blocking
transmission in the community. Likewise, it emphasizes the importance of
broadening the view in the sense of internalizing that the passport or
vaccination pass constitutes only one of the many options within a rich catalog
of possibilities when it comes to reinforcing the recommended vaccination model
through incentives adopted in the Vaccination Strategy against COVID-19,
including the use of nudging. In any case, if conditionality is installed and
expanded to the extent of significantly influencing daily life, it could lead to 
a kind of indirect obligation, with the risk of dysfunctions in terms of equality
and systemic coherence if the public powers do not contribute to clearly define
the legal limits beforehand and to drive a process that in itself could be
dispersed and disorderly.

Introduction: Promoting self-care practice, as a critical strategy for enhancing 
the quality of life in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a challenging
issue. This study aimed to propose a model of health-promoting self-care
behaviors in MS patients.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 200 patients with MS, who had referred to
the Hospital for Special Diseases in Kerman City, Iran, were chosen. The main
data collection instruments were the multiple sclerosis knowledge questionnaire, 
the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, multiple sclerosis self-efficacy scale,
questionnaire of perceived barriers and benefits of self-care behaviors, social
support, the health promotion lifestyle profile II, and resilience and sense of
coherence scale. Data analysis was conducted in SPSS V. 22 and AMOS18 software.
The Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was also used for further analysis of
data.
Results: The model explained 82% of variance in Health-Promoting self-care
Behavior (HPB). The results of the final model obtained from the SEM showed that 
self-efficacy (β=0.53, SE=0.04, P= 0.007), self-esteem (β=0.39, SE=0.04,
P=0.005), social support (β=0.36, SE=0.04, P=0.009), sense of coherence (β=0.34, 
SE=0.07, P=0.006), resilience (β=0.33, SE=0.07, P=0.018), and perceived benefits 
(β=0.25, SE=0.05, P=0.009) had a positive and significant relationship with HPB.
Conclusion: The self-care empowerment model in patients with MS presented in this
study can be used as a framework for designing health promotion interventions to 
improve the quality of life of patients with MS.

BACKGROUND: Against the backdrop of 10 years of civil war in Syria, with millions
of refugees, this study aimed to explore sense of community coherence and the
acculturation strategies of separation and competition as factors that might
explain mental-health problems among adolescent Syrian refugees in Greece.
METHODS: Data were gathered from 173 adolescents aged 13-18 (M = 15.85;
SD = 1.49); female adolescents accounted for 60.7% of the sample. Participants
filled out a self-reported questionnaire regarding internalizing and
externalizing problems, as well as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). They
were also asked about their sense of community coherence, their use of different 
acculturation strategies, and sociodemographic factors (i.e., gender, age, amount
of time spent in the camp, and parents' education), as well as contextual factors
such as exposure to war events, appraisal of danger, and whether they had
received aid from various organizations.
RESULTS: The female adolescents reported a stronger sense of community coherence 
and that they had received more aid from organizations than the male adolescents 
reported receiving. The male adolescents reported more externalizing problems.
Exposure and appraisal of danger, as well as sense of community coherence and the
use of the acculturation strategies of separation and competition all
significantly explained the various mental-health problems.
CONCLUSIONS: This article underscores the significance of gender, community
coherence, and acculturation strategies in the prediction of mental health. It
presents the results of this research in the context of the salutogenic and
acculturation models.

AIM: To evaluate factors associated with parental separation during the
parenthood transition.
DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal and explorative.
METHODS: This is a quantitative longitudinal study of N784 subjects throughout
the pregnancy journey with multivariate regression analysis of survey data
derived from three validated measurement scales; the Sense of Coherence scale,
the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support and the Perceived Quality 
of the Dyadic Relationship scale conducted 2014-2016.
RESULTS: N17 participants separated at 2 years. Parental separation was
significantly greater for those women and partners with low or changing sense of 
coherence, perceived social support and perceived quality of the parental-couple 
relationship indexes. Partners with a change in sense of coherence (p: .003) and 
perceived quality of the parental-couple relationship (p: .020) between 1 week
and 2 years were at greater risk for separation. Attending professional
preparatory support with a partner for women (p: .013) and attending the
"Inspirational Lecture" for partners (p: .046) were, to a lesser extent,
associated with a risk of parental separation.

This paper reported the quality of life (QoL) of 260 Malaysian parents with
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and factors which influencing it. About half of
these parents reported to having good QoL. The factors identified in the double
ABCX model showed that perceived social support and sense of coherence (SOC) were
mediated by coping strategies and had a positive direct and indirect effect on
parents' QoL. These finding reiterate the importance of social support, coping
skills, and strong SOC reflection skills in influencing the QoL of parents with
ASD child. We therefore suggest parents to utilize the widely available social
and organization supports to gain good QoL, which is also important for the
wellbeing of their child.

BACKGROUND: Work stress affects individual health and well-being. These negative 
effects could be mitigated through regular monitoring of employees' stress. Such 
monitoring becomes even more important as the digital transformation of the
economy implies profound changes in working conditions.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the association between
computer mouse movements and work stress in the field.
METHODS: We hypothesized that stress is associated with a speed-accuracy
trade-off in computer mouse movements. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a
longitudinal field study at a large business organization, where computer mouse
movements from regular work activities were monitored over 7 weeks; the study
included 70 subjects and 1829 observations. A Bayesian regression model was used 
to estimate whether self-reported acute work stress was associated with a
speed-accuracy trade-off in computer mouse movements.
RESULTS: There was a negative association between stress and the two-way
interaction term of mouse speed and accuracy (mean -0.32, 95% highest posterior
density interval -0.58 to -0.08), which means that stress was associated with a
speed-accuracy trade-off. The estimated association was not sensitive to
different processing of the data and remained negative after controlling for the 
demographics, health, and personality traits of subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported acute stress is associated with computer mouse
movements, specifically in the form of a speed-accuracy trade-off. This finding
suggests that the regular analysis of computer mouse movements could indicate
work stress.

Aim: To know the association of sense of coherence (SOC), caries experience, and 
socioeconomic status (SES) in 11-16-year-old schoolchildren.
Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study included a total of 595
schoolchildren aged 11-16 years, and informed consent was obtained. Demographic
and socioeconomic data were collected through pro forma filled by the parents.
Sense of coherence of children was recorded with SOC-13 item questionnaire given 
in both English and local language (Telugu). Caries experience was recorded with 
DMFT index by carrying out the intra-oral examination of children.
Results: In a total of 595 schoolchildren, 35% children have weak SOC, 34.9% have
moderate SOC, and 29.9% have strong SOC. Caries experience was inversely
associated with SOC (p value = 0.006) on analysis by ANOVA. On multivariate
regression analysis, it was observed that for every one-unit increase in SOC,
caries experience decreased by 0.11 unit. However, there was statistically no
significant (p value = 0.09) relation between childhood SES and SOC. Age (p value
= 0.08) and gender (p value = 0.19) are not associated with SOC.
Conclusion: Sense of coherence influences the caries experience irrespective of
socioeconomic status, age, and gender of the child.
Clinical significance: Children having stronger SOC have increased likelihood to 
seek out preventive dental services, which helps in maintaining good oral health.
SOC is structured mainly by the experiences during the early years of life.
Therefore, SOC can be strengthened by interventions in the early life through
school dental health programs.

Repurposing Acitretin as an Antipseudomonal Agent Targeting the Pseudomonas
aeruginosa Iron-Regulated Heme Oxygenase.

Pharmacy, 20 Penn Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, United States.

Iron is an essential micronutrient for the survival and virulence of the
bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To overcome iron withholding and
successfully colonize a host, P. aeruginosa uses a variety of mechanisms to
acquire iron, including the secretion of high-affinity iron chelators
(siderophores) or the uptake and utilization of heme. P. aeruginosa heme
oxygenase (HemO) plays pivotal roles in heme sensing, uptake, and utilization and
has emerged as a therapeutic target for the development of antipseudomonal
agents. Using a high-throughput fluorescence quenching assay combined with
minimum inhibitory concentration measurements, we screened the Selleck Bioactive 
collection of 2100 compounds and identified acitretin, a Food and Drug
Administration-approved oral retinoid, as a potent and selective inhibitor of
HemO. Acitretin binds to HemO with a KD value of 0.10 ± 0.02 μM and inhibits the 
growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 with an IC50 of 70 ± 18 μg/mL. In addition,
acitretin showed good selectivity for HemO, which uniquely generates BVIXβ/δ,
over human heme oxygenase (hHO1) and other BVIXα-producing homologues such as the
heme oxygenases from Neisseria meningitidis (nmHO) and Acinetobacter baumannii
(abHO). The binding of acitretin within the HemO active site was confirmed by
1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance, and
molecular modeling provided further insight into potential interactions of
acitretin with residues specific for orienting heme in the β/δ selective HemO.
Moreover, at 20 μM, acitretin inhibited the enzymatic activity of HemO in P.
aeruginosa cells by >60% and effectively blocked the ability of P. aeruginosa to 
sense and acquire heme as demonstrated in the β-galactosidase transcriptional
reporter assay.

ABSTRACT: This review sought to investigate the accuracy of traumatic memories in
persons with a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PubMed,
PsycINFO, and Embase were searched for articles, and 11 studies were included.
Three different methods of studying memory accuracy were identified in the
included articles: coherence, change in recollection of trauma over time, and
remembering details of trauma. Three studies found a deficiency in the accuracy
of traumatic memory. Despite some inconsistencies, most of the studies concluded 
that the memory of trauma is as accurate in people with as in those without PTSD.
The only recurring difference identified across studies was in recollection of
trauma over time. The findings are of importance both clinically and for the
legal system.

BACKGROUND: Most research on burnout has focused on its antecedents, correlates, 
and consequences. However, little empirical attention has been paid to what
constitutes successful rehabilitation after burnout, especially among young
employees.
OBJECTIVE: The present study empirically examined resources supporting successful
rehabilitation after burnout among young employees (between 18 and 35 years of
age) from a salutogenic perspective.
METHODS: Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used as a methodological
framework to explain the experiences of young employees underlying their
rehabilitation after burnout.
RESULTS: The analysis showed that the rehabilitation process comprises four
phases: 1) facing the crisis; 2) addressing the root causes; 3) seizing and
achieving the opportunity; and 4) staying at work. Essential overarching
resources facilitating successful recovery after burnout included receiving
social support from family, friends, and colleagues, as well as having a feeling 
of control over the rehabilitation process. Participants learned to be aware of
potential pitfalls that could trigger burnout symptoms, while having confidence
in their ability to prevent burnout from reoccurring. These continuous learning
processes were experienced as a prerequisite to remain at work.
CONCLUSIONS: Receiving social support and experiencing a feeling of control over 
the rehabilitation process appear to be key resources in facilitating a stable,
meaningful return to work after burnout.

AIM: To investigate the mediation/moderation effect between Coping Behaviors
(CBs) and Sense of Coherence (SOC) in the prediction of health-related quality of
life (HRQoL) in breast cancer patients.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
METHODS: A total of 221 patients were included in this study. The 13-item
Orientation to Life Questionnaire, Brief COPE and Functional Assessment of Cancer
Therapy-Breast were investigated. Pearson's correlation coefficient and
mediation/moderation analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Significant correlations were observed for SOC, active coping,
acceptance, positive reframing (PR), planning, use of emotional support (UES),
use of instrumental support, behaviour disengagement and self-blame with HRQoL.
Except for planning and acceptance, SOC partially mediated the CBs' effect on
HRQoL. The UES and PR's effects on HRQoL were significant at lower SOC levels and
diminished at higher SOC levels.
CONCLUSION: Practitioners can incorporate SOC and adaptive CBs, including PR and 
UES, into the rehabilitation programmes to improve HRQoL in patients.

Challenges for Nontechnical Implementation of Digital Proximity Tracing During
the COVID-19 Pandemic: Media Analysis of the SwissCovid App.

von Wyl V(1)(2).

Zürich, Switzerland.

Zürich, Switzerland.

BACKGROUND: Several countries have released digital proximity tracing (DPT) apps 
to complement manual contact tracing for combatting the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. DPT 
aims to notify app users about proximity exposures to persons infected with
SARS-CoV-2 so that they can self-quarantine. The success of DPT apps depends on
user acceptance and the embedding of DPT into the pandemic mitigation strategy.
OBJECTIVE: By searching for media articles published during the first 3 months
after DPT launch, the implementation of DPT in Switzerland was evaluated to
inform similar undertakings in other countries. The second aim of the study was
to create a link between reported DPT implementation challenges and normalization
process theory for planning and optimizing complex digital health interventions, 
which can provide useful guidance for decision-making in DPT design and
implementation.
METHODS: A Swiss media database was searched for articles on the Swiss DPT app
(SwissCovid) published in German or French between July 4 and October 3, 2020. In
a structured process, topics were extracted and clustered manually from articles 
that were deemed pertinent. Extracted topics were mapped to four NPT constructs, 
which reflected the flow of intervention development from planning, stakeholder
onboarding, and execution to critical appraisal. Coherence constructs describe
sense-making by stakeholders, cognitive participation constructs reflect
participants' efforts to create engagement with the intervention, collective
actions refer to intervention execution and joint stakeholder efforts to make the
intervention work, and reflexive monitoring refers to collective risk-benefit
appraisals to create improvements.
RESULTS: Out of 94 articles deemed pertinent and selected for closer inspection, 
38 provided unique information on implementation challenges. Five challenge areas
were identified: communication challenges, challenges for DPT to interface with
other processes, fear of resource competition with established pandemic
mitigation measures, unclear DPT effectiveness, and obstacles to greater user
coverage and compliance. Specifically, several articles mentioned unclear DPT
benefits to affect commitment and to raise fears among different health system
actors regarding resource competition. Moreover, media reports indicated process 
interface challenges such as delays or unclear responsibilities in the
notification cascade, as well as misunderstandings and unmet communication needs 
from health system actors. Finally, reports suggested misaligned incentives, not 
only for app usage by the public but also for process engagement by other actors 
in the app notification cascade. NPT provided a well-fitting framework to
contextualize the different DPT implementation challenges and to highlight
improvement strategies, namely a better alignment of stakeholder incentives, or
stakeholder-specific communication to address their concerns about DPT.
CONCLUSIONS: Early experiences from one of the first adopters of DPT indicate
that nontechnical implementation challenges may affect the effectiveness of DPT. 
The NPT analysis provides a novel perspective on DPT implementation and stresses 
the need for stakeholder inclusion in development and operationalization.

Employing the salutogenic model, we asked how individuals in different countries 
cope with the COVID-19 crisis and stay healthy. We were interested in exploring
the individual (i.e. sense of coherence) as well as the social and national
resources (i.e. social support, sense of national coherence, and trust in
governmental institutions) that could explain levels of mental health and anxiety
during the outbreak of the pandemic. Data collection was conducted via
convenience sampling on online platforms, during the end of March and the
beginning of April 2020. The data included four samples: 640 Israeli participants
(319 males), 622 Dutch participants (177 males), 924 Italian participants (338
males) and 489 Spanish participants (117 males); age range of 18-88 years. The
questionnaires included standard tools (MHC-SF, GAD-7, SOC, SONC). Several
questions were adapted to the context of coronavirus and measured levels of
exposure to COVID-19, trust in governmental institutions, and social support. The
results significantly confirmed the suggested salutogenic model regarding the
contribution to individual and national coping resources to anxiety levels and
mental health. The patterns of the coping resources in explaining anxiety and
mental health were similar in the four samples, and SOC was the main predictor
these outcomes. Despite these similarities, a different pattern and also
different magnitudes of the predictive value of the coping resources were found
for the two different reactions: anxiety vs. mental health. While SOC and
situational factors (like financial threat) were significant in explaining
anxiety levels, the SOC and national resources were found as significant in
explaining mental health levels. The findings support the salutogenic approach in
studying reactions during pandemic time. They also shed some light on the
difference between pathogenic and salutogenic measures in studying psychological 
reactions to stressful situations.

BACKGROUND: Experiences of violence and abuse is a prominent part of the life
history of many older adults and is known to have negative health effects.
However, the importance of multiple victimization over the life course, e.g.,
lifetime polyvictimization, is not well investigated in this age group. The
objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of lifetime physical,
emotional, and sexual victimization as well as polyvictimization among older
adults in Sweden. We explored background characteristics associated with
polyvictimization and hypothesized that violence victimization and especially
polyvictimization would be associated with lower health status. To better
understand factors that promote health in the aftermath of victimization, we also
explored the effect of two resilience factors, sense of coherence (SOC) and
social support, on the association between victimization and ill-health.
METHOD: Cross-sectional data from a random population sample in Sweden (women
n = 270, men n = 337) aged 60-85 was used. Respondents answered questions about
exposure to violence, health status, social support, and SOC. Conditional process
analysis was used to test if SOC mediates the association between victimization
and health outcome, and if social support moderates the association.
RESULTS: Overall, 24.8% of the women and 27.6% of the men reported some form of
lifetime victimization and 82.1% of the female and 62.4% of the male victims were
classified as polyvictims, i.e., reported experiences of more than one episode of
violence. As hypothesized, we found a negative association between victimization 
and health status and the association was most prominent for polyvictims. We
found moderated mediation for the association between polyvictimization and
health status, i.e., polyvictimization was associated with lower SOC and SOC had 
a positive correlation with health status. Social support moderated the
association, i.e., victims without social support had lower health scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime polyvictimization was common among older adults and
associated with lower health status. To help victims of violence recover, or
preferably never develop ill-health, a better understanding of what fosters
resilience is warranted. This study implies that social support, and especially
SOC may be factors to consider in future interventions concerning older adults
subjected to violence.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this integrative review was to describe salutogenic factors
associated with oral health outcomes in older people, from the theoretical
perspectives of Antonovsky and Lalonde.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was based on a primary selection of 10,016
articles. To organize reported salutogenic factors, the Lalonde health field
concept and Antonovsky's salutogenic theory were cross tabulated.
RESULTS: The final analysis was based on 58 studies. The following oral health
outcome variables were reported: remaining teeth, caries, periodontal disease,
oral function and oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL). We could identify
77 salutogenic factors for oral health and OHRQoL. Salutogenic factors were
identified primarily within the fields of Human Biology (such as 'higher saliva
flow', 'BMI < 30 kg/m2' and 'higher cognitive ability at age 11'), Lifestyle
(such as 'higher education level', 'social network diversity' and 'optimal oral
health behaviour') and Environment (such as 'lower income inequality', 'public
water fluoridation' and 'higher neighbourhood education level'). In the age group
60 years and over, there was a lack of studies with specific reference to
salutogenic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The results provide an overview of salutogenic factors for oral
health from two theoretical perspectives. The method allowed concomitant
disclosure of both theoretical perspectives and examination of their congruence. 
Further hypothesis-driven research is needed to understand how elderly people can
best maintain good oral health.

BACKGROUND: : Research implicates psychological factors in low uptake of lung
cancer screening. We developed and psychometrically tested a standardised measure
of these psychological determinants in preparation for a prospective,
longitudinal cohort study of screening uptake.
METHODS: : Leventhal's Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation of Health and
Illness provided the theoretical framework to generate the initial item pool.
Items were refined during expert review and cognitive interviews which tested for
face validity, redundancy, acceptability and comprehensibility. An online survey 
piloted the refined pool with 1500 current and former (quit ≤ 15 years) smokers
aged 55-80. The response distributions, internal reliability and factor structure
determined the final retained constructs. Regression analyses examined these
constructs' associations with screening intention, smoking status and
demographics.
RESULTS: : The final measure included seven factor-derived subscales
(consequences, personal control, treatment control, illness coherence, emotional 
representation, behavioural response and appraisal, risk perception) with
Cronbach's alphas ranging from 0.59 to 0.91 and four single-item questions
(response efficacy for smoking cessation, treatment intention, perceived stigma
and lung cancer survival). Most constructs were associated with smoking status
and screening intention (p's < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: : The Self-Regulatory Questionnaire for Lung Cancer Screening
(SRQ-LCS) is an acceptable, reliable and valid measure for investigating the
psychological determinants of screening uptake.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate birth outcome and birth experience in
relation to women's emotional health. An additional aim was to explore the
relationship between emotional health, continuity with a known midwife, and the
birth experience.
METHODS: A prospective longitudinal cohort study of 243 women enrolled in a
continuity of care project in a rural area in Sweden. Profiles were constructed
from instruments measuring depressive symptoms, worries, fear of birth, and sense
of coherence. Antenatal and birth records and questionnaires were used to collect
data.
RESULT: Women were categorized into two cluster profiles: "emotionally healthy"
vs. "emotionally unhealthy". Women in the "emotionally unhealthy" cluster had a
less positive birth experience (p = 0.006). The total score of the Childbirth
Experience Questionnaire was highest in women who had had a known midwife
assisting at birth. Babies born to women in the "emotionally unhealthy" cluster
were more likely to have a severe neonatal diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: There were few differences in birth outcome between the clusters,
while there were explicit differences in the childbirth experience. Having a
known midwife is important to warrant women a more positive childbirth
experience. Screening with validated instruments during antenatal care could be a
first step to further investigate women's emotional well-being and provide
targeted psychosocial support.

People with cardiovascular risk have more depression than the general population.
Depression and cardiovascular risk have been commonly linked to lower sense of
coherence (SOC) values, unhealthy lifestyles, and poor sleep quality. The aim of 
this study was to analyze the association between depression, health-related
lifestyles, sleep quality, and SOC in a population with cardiovascular risk. A
cross-sectional study was conducted in 310 participants (aged 35-75 years) with
cardiovascular risk. Sociodemographic and anthropometric characteristics,
cardiovascular risk, SOC score, depression levels, sleep quality, and lifestyles 
(physical activity, diet quality (measured as the adherence to the Mediterranean 
diet), and tobacco and alcohol consumption) were determined. The regression
analysis showed significant associations between depression levels and sex (odds 
ratio (OR): 2.29; 95% CI: 1.29, 4.07), diet (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.99), body 
mass index (BMI) (OR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.12), cardiovascular disease (CVD)
(OR: 2.55; 95% CI: 1.18, 5.48), sleep quality (OR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.46), and
SOC (OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.94, 0.98). Protective effects of male sex, a lower BMI, 
no CVD, a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, a high sleep quality, and a
higher SOC were found. In conclusion, among lifestyles determined, only diet was 
associated with depression levels. SOC and sleep quality were also found as
significant predictors for depression levels.

Personal recovery is a process of developing new meaning and purpose in life
beyond the catastrophic effects of mental illness. Benefit finding (BF) is
conceptualized as finding positive changes or benefits through experiences in
adversity. Sense of coherence (SOC) focuses on how people can stay healthy and
maintain well-being, even in adversity. This study aimed to examine the
relationships among the initial levels and longitudinal changes in personal
recovery, BF, and SOC among people with chronic mental illness in Japan. In this 
longitudinal study, a two-wave self-report questionnaire survey was conducted for
service users aged 20 or older with mental illness using convenience sampling
method in 2014 and 2015. We applied the Latent Change Score approach. Model fit
was evaluated according to the CFI and RMSEA. Among 373 eligible participants at 
baseline, valid responses in both T1 and T2 from 195 respondents were included in
the study (valid response rate = 52.3%). Among them, 65.6% were male, with
average age of 45.6. The model of the three constructs at the two time points had
good to reasonable fit to the data. The initial levels and changes in personal
recovery, BF, and SOC were significantly and positively related to each other.

Mantener un adecuado control de la diabetes se relaciona con variables como
autocuidado y sentido de coherencia que reducen las tasas de morbilidad y
mortalidad. El objetivo fue evaluar el efecto mediador del sentido de coherencia 
en la relación entre autocuidado y niveles de glucosa en sangre de personas con
diabetes. A 220 sujetos con diabetes mellitus tipo 2 se les aplicó un instrumento
para autocuidado y otro para sentido de coherencia, mientras que la hemoglobina
glucosilada se obtuvo del expediente médico, posteriormente se analizaron los
datos por medio de un modelo de ecuaciones estructurales. Los resultados muestran
que el tanto el autocuidado (c' = -0.33; p < 0.05), como el sentido de coherencia
(b = -0.34; p < 0.05) tienen un efecto directo sobre los niveles de glucosa, así 
como también un efecto indirecto significativo (-0.168; p < 0.05). El efecto
total de AC sobre A1c corresponden a -0.498. En consecuencia, este modelo
estimado corresponde a un modelo de mediación simple parcial. Los resultados
confirman la hipótesis de que el sentido de coherencia en personas con diabetes
media la relación entre AC y HbA1c. El enfoque salutogénico mejora la adherencia 
a las conductas de autocuidado, lo que puede facilitar el control glucémico de la
enfermedad.

The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between the participants'
self-reported quality of life and their sense of coherence in a sample (n = 85)
of patients on treatment with oral antivitamin K anticoagulants. A
cross-sectional design was used. The measurement instruments included a
questionnaire on sociodemographic variables, the Spanish version of the
Abbreviated World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire
(WHOQOL-BREF), an oral-anticoagulant-treatment-specific quality-of-life
questionnaire, and the sense-of-coherence (SOC) scale. We analyzed the
correlations between the participants' characteristics and the results from the
quality-of-life and SOC scales. Age, level of education, employment status,
living arrangement, and treatment length were the determinants of the quality of 
life in people treated with oral anticoagulants. We found a significant
association between the four domains of the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire and general
treatment satisfaction (p < 0.01); no significant correlations were found between
the SOC subscales and the oral-anticoagulant-treatment-specific quality of life
in our sample. Women had a worse level of self-management than men. Nursing
interventions should be tailored to the needs of the populations on treatment
with oral anticoagulants in order to facilitate a higher level of
self-management.

BACKGROUND: Communicating risks of medication harm and obtaining informed consent
is difficult due to structural barriers, language and cultural practices, bias
and a lack of resources appropriately tailored for the health literacy of most
patients. A decision support tool was proposed to alert prescribers of risk and
provide tailored information for patients to facilitate informed decision-making 
with patients and their whānau (family) around medication use. Patient and
prescriber co-design was used to ensure the tool was designed to best meet the
needs of end-users and avoid increasing health inequity. This paper describes the
first stage of the co-design process.
METHOD: Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) was used to prospectively evaluate the
tool. Semi-structured interviews were held with fifteen patients (five Māori,
five Pasifika and five NZ European) and nine general practitioners (two Māori and
seven European).
RESULTS: Three themes were identified, which related to the three NPT concepts
most relevant to developing the tool. Theme 1 (coherence: meaning and sense
making by participants) explored participants' understanding of prescribing
safety, medication harm and risk, which is based on experience. Patients want as 
much information as possible about their medications and risk, but doctors find
it difficult to communicate that information. Theme 2 related to the NPT concept 
of cognitive participation (commitment and engagement by participants) explored
what participants thought about a prescribing decision support tool. Participants
were cautiously optimistic, but worried about potential harm arising from its
use. They also identified requirements for the tool and features to avoid. Theme 
3 describes the collective action required for successful implementation of the
tool; namely, culturally safe and trustworthy doctor-patient relationships.
CONCLUSION: Patients and general practitioners provided different perspectives
when prospectively evaluating the proposed risk assessment and communication
tool. This co-design research identified important pre-requisites for the tool
and features to avoid and novel ideas for the proposed tool. Overall participants
supported the development of the proposed risk assessment and communication tool,
but identified the important role that doctor-patient relationships would play to
ensure successful implementation. The use of Māori and Pacific languages in the
proposed tool may enhance engagement and understanding.

OBJECTIVE: To derive cluster analysis-based groupings for adults with congenital 
heart disease (ACHD) when it comes to perceived health, psychological
functioning, health behaviours and quality of life (QoL).
METHODS: This study was part of a larger worldwide multicentre study called
APPROACH-IS; a cross sectional study which recruited 4028 patients (2013-2015)
from 15 participating countries. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed
using Ward's method in order to group patients with similar psychological
characteristics, which were defined by taking into consideration the scores of
the following tests: Sense Of Coherence, Health Behavior Scale (physical exercise
score), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, Illness Perception Questionnaire,
Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Visual Analogue Scale scores of the EQ-5D
perceived health scale and a linear analogue scale (0-100) measuring QoL.
RESULTS: 3768 patients with complete data were divided into 3 clusters. The first
and second clusters represented 89.6% of patients in the analysis who reported a 
good health perception, QoL, psychological functioning and the greatest amount of
exercise. Patients in the third cluster reported substantially lower scores in
all PROs. This cluster was characterised by a significantly higher proportion of 
females, a higher average age the lowest education level, more complex forms of
congenital heart disease and more medical comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that certain demographic and clinical
characteristics may be linked to less favourable health perception, quality of
life, psychological functioning, and health behaviours in ACHD. This information 
may be used to improve psychosocial screening and the timely provision of
psychosocial care.

BACKGROUND: U.S. hospitals and dialysis centers are penalized for 30-day hospital
readmissions of dialysis patients, despite little infrastructure to facilitate
care transitions between these settings. We are developing a third-party
web-based information exchange platform, DialysisConnect, to enable clinicians to
view and exchange information about dialysis patients during admission,
hospitalization, and discharge. This health information technology solution could
serve as a flexible and relatively affordable solution for dialysis facilities
and hospitals across the nation who are seeking to serve as true partners in the 
improved care of dialysis patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
perceived coherence of DialysisConnect to key clinical stakeholders, to prepare
messaging for implementation.
METHODS: As part of a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study guided by
Normalization Process Theory, we collected data on stakeholder perceptions of
continuity of care for patients receiving maintenance dialysis and a
DialysisConnect prototype before completing development and piloting the system. 
We conducted four focus groups with stakeholders from one academic hospital and
associated dialysis centers [hospitalists (n = 5), hospital staff (social
workers, nurses, pharmacists; n = 9), nephrologists (n = 7), and dialysis clinic 
staff (social workers, nurses; n = 10)]. Transcriptions were analyzed
thematically within each component of the construct of coherence
(differentiation, communal specification, individual specification, and
internalization).
RESULTS: Participants differentiated DialysisConnect from usual care variously as
an information dashboard, a quick-exchange communication channel, and improved
discharge information delivery; some could not differentiate it in terms of
workflow. The purpose of DialysisConnect (communal specification) was viewed as
fully coherent only for communicating outside of the same healthcare system.
Current system workarounds were acknowledged as deterrents for practice change.
All groups delegated DialysisConnect tasks (individual specification) to
personnel besides themselves. Partial internalization of DialysisConnect was
achieved only by dialysis clinic staff, based on experience with similar
technology.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementing DialysisConnect for clinical users in both settings
will require presenting a composite picture of current communication processes
from all stakeholder groups to correct single-group misunderstandings, as well as
providing data about care transitions communication beyond the local context to
ease resistance to practice change.

BACKGROUND: Sense of coherence (SOC) is a personal resource that allows people to
stay healthy in spite of stressful situations. SOC is known to be low in eating
disorders. We explored whether SOC correlated with anorexia nervosa (AN) symptoms
several years after initial hospitalization for AN, to inform us whether AN
treatment concepts could more specifically focus on increasing SOC.
METHODS: Former patients were contacted 5-11 years after hospitalization for AN
in a German integrative medicine hospital. Participants completed the Eating
Disorder Inventory (EDI-2) and the SOC Questionnaire (SOC-13). Hospital records
were reviewed. Correlations between EDI-2 subscales and SOC-13 were tested. A
t-test was conducted to assess the difference between the SOC-13 and the norm. A 
median split was performed, dividing SOC scores into two groups and comparing
these with EDI-2 subscales.
RESULTS: Of 149 previously hospitalized female patients, 83 could be contacted
and 68 agreed to participate (46%). 17.6% self-reported that they currently
suffered from an eating disorder. The mean follow-up time was 7.2 years. All
EDI-2 subscales correlated negatively with the SOC-13 score (p < .01). The mean
SOC was significantly lower than the norm (p < .001). In the median split, the
lower SOC group had significantly higher scores on all EDI-2 subscales.
CONCLUSIONS: Amongst previously hospitalized AN patients, the SOC was lower than 
a normative sample and correlated with on-going eating disorder symptoms in
long-term follow-up. Strengthening SOC as a personal resource should be
incorporated as a specific goal in AN treatment and its impact on long-term
outcomes evaluated.

INTRODUCTION: According to WHO, midwives are found competent to provide
evidencebased and normalcy-facilitating maternity care. Models for midwifery care
exist, but seem to be lacking explicit epistemological status, mainly focusing on
the practical and organizational level of care delivery. To make the values and
attitudes of care visible, it is important to implement care models with explicit
epistemological status. The aim of this paper is to identify and gain an overview
of publications of theoretical models for midwifery care.
METHODS: A mapping review was conducted with systematic searches in nine
databases for studies describing a theoretical model or theory for midwifery care
that either did or was intended to impact clinical practice. Eligibility criteria
were refined during the selection process.
RESULTS: Six models from six papers originating from different parts of the world
were included in the study. The included models were developed using different
methodologies and had different philosophical underpinnings and complexity
gradients. Some characteristics were common, the most distinctive being the
emphasis of the midwife-woman relationship, secondly the focus on
woman-centeredness, and thirdly the salutogenic focus in care.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, scarcity exists regarding theoretical models for midwifery 
care with explicit epistemological status. Further research is needed in order to
develop generic theoretical models with an epistemological status to serve as a
knowledge base for midwifery healthcare.

BACKGROUND: Research increasingly highlight post-migration factors for migrants' 
mental health status. We investigated the association between participation in a 
health promotion program and changes in migrants' mental health, and if
socio-demographic factors and length of time in the new home country, Sweden,
influenced a potential association.
METHODS: A five-week health promotion program named 'Hälsostöd' [Health Support],
led by community health workers, was offered to migrants, primarily asylum
seekers and newly arrived immigrants (N = 202). The framework for the program was
salutogenic psycho-education, which focused on health effects of migration
experiences, lifestyle and health, and the health care system. Mental health was 
measured at the start and end of the program. We analysed this follow up by using
the recommended clinical cut off (i.e. > 11 of maximum 36, with higher scores
indicating possible mental illness) in the 12- item version of the General Health
Questionnaire (GHQ12). Chi Square test was used to analyse statistical
significance of changes, and multinomial logistic regression to analyse
associations to sociodemographic factors and length of stay in Sweden.
RESULTS: The number of participants scoring above the clinical cut off after
participation in the program (N = 79, 39.1%) was lower compared to the
corresponding number before participation (N = 111, 55.0%), Chi Square = 10.17,
p < .001. The majority of the participants had no change 72.3 (N = 146), 21.8%
(N = 44) had a positive change, yet 5.9% (N = 12) had a negative change, compared
to before participation in the program. None of the investigated sociodemographic
factors showed to significantly influence the association. Length of stay in
Sweden was trending, with participants with longer stay being more likely to have
possible mental illness.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that psycho-educative programs, similar to 'Hälsostöd',
have potential for promoting asylum seekers' and newly arrived immigrants' mental
health as the evaluation showed a considerable number of positive changes in
participants. The result suggests the importance of offering immigrants health
promotive programs in close connection with arrival to the new home country.
Future research should clarify under what circumstances sociodemographic factors 
influence the effects of such programs.

BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to a general uncertainty about risk and
consequences of the disease. Older adults are specifically vulnerable with regard
to severe courses of the disease and have been particularly encouraged to
self-isolate during the pandemic. Subsequently, expressions of concern have been 
raised regarding the negative impact of disease risk and quarantine on the mental
health of older people.
OBJECTIVES: Assessment of psychosocial stress, coping strategies, need for
support, and sense of coherence of older people during the COVID-19 pandemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study follows a qualitative research design. Between
May and June 2020 N = 11 guided telephone interviews were conducted with older
adults (70+ years). Telephone interviews were recorded by audio tape and fully
transcribed. A qualitative content analysis was performed according to Mayring
and Fenzl (2019) using MAXQDA.
RESULTS: Participants were 74.8 years old on average. Participants showed
predominantly good psychosocial health and functional coping strategies. Life
experience, an optimistic attitude, understanding of the necessity of
restrictions, and previous crises that have been mastered were the most important
resources during the COVID-19 pandemic for older adults. Offers of support were
rarely used. Participants were critical of the closing of centers or meeting
points for older people.
CONCLUSION: Older adults appear to be able to preserve their mental wellbeing
during the COVID-19 pandemic. The relevance of mental resources of older adults
for supporting younger generations seems to be unrecognized.

In common sense experience based on introspection, consciousness is singular.
There is only one 'me' and that is the one that is conscious. This means that
'singularity' is a defining aspect of 'consciousness'. However, the three main
theories of consciousness, Integrated Information, Global Workspace and Recurrent
Processing theory, are generally not very clear on this issue. These theories
have traditionally relied heavily on neuropsychological observations and have
interpreted various disorders, such as anosognosia, neglect and split-brain as
impairments in conscious awareness without any reference to 'the singularity'. In
this review, we will re-examine the theoretical implications of these impairments
in conscious awareness and propose a new way how to conceptualize consciousness
of singularity. We will argue that the subjective feeling of singularity can
coexist with several disunified conscious experiences. Singularity awareness may 
only come into existence due to environmental response constraints. That is,
perceptual, language, memory, attentional and motor processes may largely proceed
unintegrated in parallel, whereas a sense of unity only arises when organisms
need to respond coherently constrained by the affordances of the environment.
Next, we examine from this perspective psychiatric disorders and psycho-active
drugs. Finally, we present a first attempt to test this hypothesis with a resting
state imaging experiment in a split-brain patient. The results suggest that there
is substantial coherence of activation across the two hemispheres. These data
show that a complete lesioning of the corpus callosum does not, in general, alter
the resting state networks of the brain. Thus, we propose that we have separate
systems in the brain that generate distributed conscious. The sense of
singularity, the experience of a 'Me-ness', emerges in the interaction between
the world and response-planning systems, and this leads to coherent activation in
the different functional networks across the cortex.

INTRODUCTION: Self-transcendence is a human capacity for wellbeing by expanding
one's personal boundaries and may act as a health-promoting resource among adults
≥65 years. Therefore, the objectives of this meta-analysis were to determine the 
mean score of self-transcendence based on place of residence and gender, and to
evaluate the correlations of self-transcendence with meaning, sense of coherence,
resilience and depression.
METHODS: Based on inclusion criteria, 13 studies were included. Orwin Safe N and 
Egger's test assessed publication bias. The mean score of self-transcendence and 
the correlation coefficients of the selected variables were estimated by random
effects models.
RESULTS: The self-transcendence mean score (n = 1634) was low (M = 43.6) and a
bit lower among those staying in care facilities (M = 42.8), but did not vary
significantly across gender. The correlation coefficients were
self-transcendence_depression (r = -0.40), self-transcendence_meaning-in-life
(r = 0.53), self-transcendence_resilience (r = 0.50) and self-transcendence_sense
of coherence (r = 0.28). The correlation coefficients, except for
meaning-in-life, were homogeneous.
CONCLUSION: In a health-promoting perspective, the concept of self-transcendence 
can help to better understand wellbeing among older individuals and provide
guidance for health professionals in facilitating wellbeing and health. The
concept and theory of self-transcendence can inspire health professionals in
realising new health-promoting approaches to support older individuals in
maintaining health, wellbeing and independency.

Chile has established hybrid policies for the administrative distribution of its 
educational establishments, leading to significant gaps in educational results
and school conditions between public, mixed, and private schools. As a result,
there are high levels of segregation, and social and economic vulnerability that 
put public schools at a disadvantage, affecting their image and causing a
constant decrease in enrollment. An abbreviated version of Luhtanen and Crocker's
(1992) collective self-esteem scale was adapted and validated for the Chilean
educational context because of its usefulness in studying processes of social
segregation and cultural coherence, seeking to identify student perception about 
the appreciation of school actions in the context of belonging and identification
with schools, in order to compare between groups according to types of
establishment and assess the effects of school conditions on the perception of
students. A representative sample of Chilean secondary students between 9th and
12th grades participated (n = 3635, 52.8% women, average age 15.9 years, SD =
1.1). Descriptive analyses, comparison of means between groups, confirmatory
factorial analyses, and multi-group analyses were conducted to test the
adjustment and invariance of the unifactorial structure of a reduced version of
four items. The results indicated that the scale satisfactorily complies with the
proposed adjustment indexes, presents total invariance by gender and partial
invariance by administrative dependence, and allows establishing statistically
significant differences in the collective self-esteem, indicating a higher score 
for students in the private system, and a lower score for those in the public
system. These results show the negative effects of high school segregation on
students' collective self-esteem, affecting the appreciation of personal,
collective, and institutional activities and the sense of belonging. Although
previous research has explored some of the effects of school segregation, the
present study focuses on collective self-esteem, which is closely related to
identity and belonging, and allows for further innovative research on school
segregation. The scale is useful as an instrument for researching social
conditions of student well-being, in regards to educational management.

Imaging studies in anxiety disorders (AD) show abnormal functional connectivity
primarily in the salience network (SN), somatomotor network (SMN), and default
mode network (DMN). However, it is not clear how precisely these network changes 
occur including their relation to psychopathological symptoms. Here, we show that
the functional networks affected in AD overlap with cortical regions that receive
visceral inputs (the so-called central/visceral autonomic network). Focusing on
cardiac afferents, we suggest that network changes in AD may be due to reduced
phase synchronization between ongoing neural and cardiac activity. This
neuro-cardiac desynchronization occurs due to the abnormal phase resetting of
neural activity at the onset of each heartbeat, as measured by a lower intertrial
coherence and heartbeat-evoked potential. Biochemically, cardiac afferents reach 
subcortical serotonergic raphe nuclei and noradrenergic locus coeruleus (among
others) which, in turn, are known to reciprocally modulate the DMN and SMN/SN on 
the cortical level. Consistent with the network changes in AD, decreases in
serotonergic and noradrenergic activity are known to increase connectivity in
both SMN and SN while, at the same time, they decrease DMN connectivity. SMN and 
SN increases, in turn, lead to increased emotional arousal/anxiety and bodily
awareness whereas decreased DMN connectivity leads to an unstable sense-of-self
in AD. Finally, we integrate our proposal with interoceptive predictive
processing models suggesting neuro-cardiac desynchronization as a mechanism for
"noisy" bottom-up information leading to a persistently uncertain bodily state in
top-down models. In sum, integrating theories on active interference and
hyperarousal, we propose a precise neuro-cardiac and biochemically -driven
mechanisms for key psychopathological symptoms of AD.

Sciences, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences , Bergen, Norway.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to explore experiences with daily
challenges and the development of salutogenic copings skills among young adults
with serious mental illness.
METHODS: Nine young adults with serious mental illness were interviewed. The
interviews were transcribed and subjected to reflexive thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Two main themes were identified through the analysis: "The influence of 
symptoms in everyday life and challenges with participating in the community" and
"Making the small things matter." The findings show that different life
experiences, or on-going challenges, often can affect or interfere their lives on
a daily basis, and that previous experiences with psychosis can contribute to the
development of salutogenic coping skills.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the importance of increased knowledge and awareness
of different life experiences and challenges among people with serious mental
illness such as schizophrenia spectrum disorders. It is significant to strengthen
the ability to identify and use appropriate resistance resources to promote
salutogenic coping skills and thus better health. Furthermore, it is important to
be aware that the development of salutogenic coping skills must be personalized
to cultural contexts and society as well as supported by local communities,
families and services.

distress and health-related quality of life in patients receiving cancer
chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: This study is aimed at examining the buffering effect of sense of
coherence (SOC) on symptom distress during cancer drug therapy, which thereby
affects health-related quality of life (QoL), and obtaining suggestions for
promoting supportive care.
METHODS: We investigated health-related QoL (SF-8), symptom distress (using the
Symptom Distress Scale (SDS)), and SOC (the SOC 13-item Scale) in 66 patients
receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer. We employed
descriptive statistics to seek the correlation of each variable; then, a
hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted with SF-8 score as the
dependent variable.
RESULTS: Results showed that significant changes in bodily pain showed a
buffering effect on the SDS and sense of comprehensibility (β = - 0.658,
p < 0.01, β = - 0.319, p < 0.05), sense of manageability (β = - 0.658, p < 0.01, 
β = 0.398, p < 0.01), and meaningfulness (β = - 0.658, p < 0.01, β = - 0.257,
p < 0.05). Significant changes in general health perception showed a buffering
effect on the SDS and sense of manageability (β = - 0.406, p < 0.01, β = 0.329,
p < 0.05). As a result of the simple inclination test, SOC proved to be effective
under high levels of symptom distress; the buffering effect of sense of
manageability was reversed regarding bodily pain; and when meaningfulness was
lower, it had a positive effect on QoL.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that SOC exerts a buffering effect in situations 
where symptoms are highly painful. It also revealed that the effect of SOC was
reversed for bodily pain and that a high SOC had a negative effect on QoL.

AIMS: To determine psychological factors predicting changes in OHRQoL and
clinical status after periodontal treatment.
METHODS: Cohort of 140 patients with chronic periodontitis receiving non-surgical
treatment consisting of scaling, root surface debridement and instruction in
plaque control. Participants self-completed questionnaires enquiring about sense 
of coherence, locus of control, self-esteem and task-specific self-efficacy
before treatment, and the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 before treatment, at oral
hygiene review and end of study. Relationships among OHRQoL, clinical changes,
individual factors (demographic and psychological) and environmental
characteristics were analysed using latent growth curve modelling guided by the
Wilson and Cleary model.
RESULTS: OHRQoL and periodontal status improved after treatment. Being male and
having a greater sense of coherence predicted better OHRQoL before treatment.
Stronger internal dimension of locus of control predicted a greater rate of
improvement in OHRQoL, whereas greater external dimensions predicted a slower
rate of improvement. Greater task-specific self-efficacy predicted less gains in 
probing attachment and reductions in probing depth.
CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of psychological factors may be helpful in explaining
individual differences in OHRQoL and clinical responses to periodontal treatment,
and in identifying where health-promoting interventions may strengthen relevant
factors to improve these outcomes.

UNICEF UK Baby Friendly Initiative: Providing, receiving and leading infant
feeding care in a hospital maternity setting-A critical ethnography.

Although breastfeeding is known to improve health, economic and environmental
outcomes, breastfeeding initiation and continuation rates are low in the United
Kingdom. The global WHO/UNICEF Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) aims to
reverse declining rates of breastfeeding by shifting the culture of infant
feeding care provision throughout hospital maternity settings. In the United
Kingdom, the global BFHI has been adapted by UNICEF UK reflecting a paradigm
shift towards the experiences of women and families using maternity services.
This research used a critical ethnographic approach to explore the influence of
the national UNICEF UK Baby Friendly Initiative (BFI) standards on the culture of
one typical maternity service in England, over a period of 8 weeks, across four
phases of data collection between 2011 and 2017. Twenty-one staff and 26 service 
users were recruited and engaged in moderate-level participant observation and/or
guided interviews and conversations. Basic, organising and a final global theme
emerged through thematic network analysis, describing the influence of the BFI on
providing, receiving and leading infant feeding care in a hospital maternity
setting. Using Antonovsky's sense of coherence construct, the findings discussed 
in this paper highlight how the BFI offers 'informational' (comprehensible),
'practical' (manageable) and 'emotional' (meaningful) support for both staff and 
service users, strengthened by effective, local leadership and a team approach.
This is juxtaposed against the tensions and demands of the busy hospital
maternity setting. It is recommended that ongoing infant feeding policy, practice
and leadership balance relational and rational approaches for positive infant
feeding care and experiences to flourish.

Hydroclimatic time series analysis focuses on a few feature types (e.g.,
autocorrelations, trends, extremes), which describe a small portion of the entire
information content of the observations. Aiming to exploit a larger part of the
available information and, thus, to deliver more reliable results (e.g., in
hydroclimatic time series clustering contexts), here we approach hydroclimatic
time series analysis differently, i.e., by performing massive feature extraction.
In this respect, we develop a big data framework for hydroclimatic variable
behaviour characterization. This framework relies on approximately 60 diverse
features and is completely automatic (in the sense that it does not depend on the
hydroclimatic process at hand). We apply the new framework to characterize mean
monthly temperature, total monthly precipitation and mean monthly river flow. The
applications are conducted at the global scale by exploiting 40-year-long time
series originating from over 13 000 stations. We extract interpretable knowledge 
on seasonality, trends, autocorrelation, long-range dependence and entropy, and
on feature types that are met less frequently. We further compare the examined
hydroclimatic variable types in terms of this knowledge and, identify patterns
related to the spatial variability of the features. For this latter purpose, we
also propose and exploit a hydroclimatic time series clustering methodology. This
new methodology is based on Breiman's random forests. The descriptive and
exploratory insights gained by the global-scale applications prove the usefulness
of the adopted feature compilation in hydroclimatic contexts. Moreover, the
spatially coherent patterns characterizing the clusters delivered by the new
methodology build confidence in its future exploitation. Given this spatial
coherence and the scale-independent nature of the delivered feature values (which
makes them particularly useful in forecasting and simulation contexts), we
believe that this methodology could also be beneficial within regionalization
frameworks, in which knowledge on hydrological similarity is exploited in
technical and operative terms.

BACKGROUND: Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is the most frequent retinal hereditary
disease and every kind of transmission pattern has been described. The genetic
etiology of RP is extremely heterogeneous and in the last few years the large
application of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approaches improved the
diagnostic yield, elucidating previously unexplained RP causes and new
genotype-phenotype correlations. The objective of this study was to reevaluate a 
previously reported family affected by Coats'-type RP without genetic diagnosis
and to describe the new genetic findings.
CASE PRESENTATION: Cohort, prospective, and single-center observational family
case. Three individuals of a family, consisting of a mother and four sons, with a
Coats phenotype were revaluated after 25 years of clinical follow-up using visual
acuity tests, ophthalmoscopy, Goldmann visual field, electroretinography (ERG),
and spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Specifically, a RP NGS
panel was performed on one member of the family and segregation analysis was
required for the other affected and unaffected members. NGS analysis disclosed a 
RPGR (Retinitis Pigmentosa GTPase Regulator) gene truncating variant segregating 
with the phenotype in all the three affected members. RPGR mutations are reported
as causative of an X-linked RP.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported family with a Coats'-type RP associated
to a RPGR mutation and segregating as a dominant X-linked disease, confirming the
hypothesis of the genetic origin of this condition and expanding the phenotypic
spectrum of diseases caused by RPGR gene mutations. The Authors suggest RPGR gene
screening mutations in patients presenting this phenotype.

Author information: 
(1)School of Psychology, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, China.

OBJECTIVES: This study examined the relationship between sense of coherence (SOC)
and hope in older adults from a longitudinal perspective.
METHOD: 271 older adults completed self-reported questionnaires assessing hope
and SOC at 3 time points: at intake, at a 6-month follow-up, and at a 12-month
follow-up. A cross-lagged panel model was used to examine the relationship
between SOC and hope.
RESULTS: The results showed that SOC was significantly associated with the level 
of hope in the older adults at all three time points. The cross-lagged analysis
showed that the lagged effect of SOC on hope was significant, whereas the lagged 
effect of the level of hope on SOC was nonsignificant.
CONCLUSION: These results indicated that SOC predicted the level of hope 6 months
later and may be helpful for guiding older adults to increase their hope for the 
future through strategies aimed at improving their SOC.

BACKGROUND: The relevance of sense of coherence (SOC) is important to the
wellbeing of parents, especially mothers of children and adolescents with
osteogenesis imperfecta (OI).
OBJECTIVE: Determine whether the oral health status of children/adolescents with 
OI is associated with mother's SOC.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: A paired cross-sectional study was conducted with 37
children/adolescents with OI, 37 without OI, and their respective mothers. The
children/adolescents were between two and 19 years of age, mean age 7.2 years,
being 47 male and 27 female. The mothers completed Antonovsky's SOC questionnaire
(SOC-13), and the oral status of the children/adolescents was investigated. The
following clinical conditions were evaluated: dentinogenesis imperfecta,
malocclusion, gingivitis, and dental caries experience.
RESULTS: The genetic condition of the children was significantly associated with 
mother's SOC (P < .001). Mothers of children with OI had lower SOC scores (mean: 
35.6 [± 4.9]) than mothers of children without OI (mean: 38.5 [± 4.3]). In the
group with OI, a low socioeconomic status was associated with lower mother's SOC 
scores (P = .004). In both groups, dental caries experience was associated with
lower mother's SOC scores (P = .007). Most individuals with OI presented
malocclusion (78.3%) and experience of dental caries (59.4%).
CONCLUSION: Having a child with OI influenced the sense of coherence of the
mothers. Socioeconomic status and dental caries experience in children and
adolescents with OI were associated with mother's SOC.

restrictions, which may lead to anxiety about the future. As a protective factor,
sense of coherence (SOC) may play a role to reduce some psychological discomfort.
This study aimed to analyze the relationships of SOC with anxiety, digital health
literacy (DHL), information, and financial satisfaction among older adults during
the outbreak.Methods: This is part of a large-scale DHL study with a
cross-sectional survey across 41 countries. This study extracted data from three 
Asian countries (China, the Philippines, and Singapore) and included people aged 
≥60. Structural equation modeling with path analysis was utilized to examine the 
relationships of SOC with anxiety about the future and other variables.Results: A
total of 266 older adults were included, with 43.2% expressed anxiety about the
future. DHL (β=-0.13, p < 0.05) and SOC (β=-0.26, p = 0.01) were negatively
associated with anxiety, while financial and information satisfaction were not.
However, financial satisfaction (β = 0.34, p < 0.01) and DHL (β = 0.32, p = 0.01)
were positively associated with SOC. Higher SOC further mediated the negative
relationships of DHL (β= -0.11, p = 0.004) and financial satisfaction (β= -0.12, 
p = 0.004) on anxiety of older adults.Conclusions: SOC had direct negative effect
on anxiety and mediated the relationships between anxiety and DHL/financial
satisfaction. Strategies should be developed to enhance SOC and DHL among older
adults, as these capacities may help to manage anxiety during the pandemic.

This is a cross-sectional study with the objective to examine the relationships
between infertility-related stress, family sense of coherence and quality of life
of Chinese couples with infertility in Hong Kong. A convenience sample of 135
Chinese couples were recruited at the subfertility clinics of the Family Planning
Association of Hong Kong. Data were collected using the Fertility Problem
Inventory, Family Sense of Coherence Scale and Fertility Quality of Life. Path
analysis was used for data analysis. The results showed that infertility-related 
stress had a negative association with the quality of life of infertile couples
and family sense of coherence mediated the effect of infertility-related stress
on quality of life for both partners. The infertility-related stress of women had
a negative association with their husbands' quality of life. Infertile women had 
more infertility-related stress and a lower quality of life than their husbands. 
The findings provide new insights into the importance of family sense of
coherence in facilitating couples' adjustment to infertility. Culturally
competent heath care interventions should be developed to strengthen family sense
of coherence among Chinese couples with infertility and help them reduce their
infertility-related stress, thus improving their quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Distinctly, shift work is burdensome for nurses and may lead to
health problems.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to examine the nursing shift system
genres and to analyze the potentially debilitating effects upon sleep quality and
the subjective state of physical and mental health when considering varying shift
schedules.
METHODS: The first cross-sectional study (n = 639) was performed at the Clinical 
Center at the University of Pécs, and throughout various hospitals in the
South-Danubian Region. The Hungarian version of the Bergen Shift Work Sleep
Questionnaire, the Berlin Questionnaire and the 13-item Sense of Coherence Scale 
were implemented. In the longitudinal survey (n = 52), the quality of sleep was
determined by the ActiGraph GT1M type of activity meter supplemented with a sleep
diary.
RESULTS: Interestingly, most respondents weight gained among the irregular
schedule group (p = 0.004). The nurses working a flexible schedule reportedly
slept better (p = 0.003), had a higher sense of coherence (p = 0.013) and
exhibited better subjective health status (p = 0.017) than when compared with
nurses working irregular shifts. The frequency of psychosomatic complaints
aligned with the length of rest periods proved influential (p = 0.013).
CONCLUSION: Admittedly, the irregularity of work schedules is stressful for
nurses. Due to the health status of nurses, it is a worthy consideration to
establish the least exhausting work schedules.

The "wecoach" is a web-application that builds the capacities of team leaders to 
improve working conditions that are positively related to the psychological
health and well-being of their team members. The web-application works through an
automated, rule-based chat enhanced by machine learning. This so-called
conversational agent guides the team leader through a systematic project cycle,
providing a mind map of work and health, training materials, self-assessments,
and online tools to conduct team surveys and workshops, as well as
self-evaluation of progress and effectiveness. In this paper, we present the
development process of this web-application, which resulted in (1) a
comprehensive intervention approach, (2) the prototype, and (3) the
implementation of an evaluation design for a multi-level, randomized controlled
trial.

Finland.

OBJECTIVE: This study focuses on evaluating the long-term treatment outcome
(10-15 years) and patient satisfaction after orthognathic treatment with
bisagittal split osteotomy (BSSO). Furthermore, the aim was to evaluate whether
the psychosocial factor, sense of coherence (SOC) associates with long-term
patient satisfaction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study sample consisted of 57 patients who had orthognathic
treatment with BSSO. Self-completion questionnaires were distributed
approximately 1.8 years and 10-15 years after surgery to evaluate treatment
outcome. SOC was evaluated with a 12-scale questionnaire 10-15 years after the
surgery.
RESULTS: After 10-15 years following BSSO, 96% of patients were highly or
moderately satisfied with the treatment outcome and none expressed
dissatisfaction. Less educated patients were more satisfied with the treatment
outcome than those with a higher educational level. Patients who felt clear
improvement in their facial appearance expressed higher satisfaction than those
experiencing only minor facial improvement. Furthermore, patients with
improvement in orofacial pains and headaches more often expressed high
satisfaction than those without improvement of these symptoms. Patients with
strong SOC seemed to have somewhat higher scores for functional aspects of
long-term treatment outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Post-treatment satisfaction with orthognathic treatment appears to
be long-lasting. Psychosocial factors may play a role in long-term post-treatment
satisfaction. Our study strongly suggests that psychosocial factors should be
taken into account in the treatment planning of orthognathic patients.

Propolis is a polyphenolic plant resin collected by bees to protect hives against
pathogens and temperature drop. It exhibits antibacterial, antioxidant, and
antiinflammatory properties. Propolis has been reported to possess antidiabetic
properties and display beneficial effects against cardiovascular disease, gut
dysbiosis, and chronic kidney disease. It has an excellent clinical safety
profile, with no known toxic effects described so far. In this review, we discuss
the salutogenic effects of propolis, with particular reference to modulating
notable features of chronic kidney disease, notably those involving
cardiovascular risks.

Limited information exists regarding the natural development of loneliness and
its determinants among cognitively intact nursing home residents. We aimed to
examine loneliness among nursing home residents by following up for 6 years and
to determine whether sociodemographic factors, diagnosis of cancer, sense of
coherence, social support, and depression symptoms influence loneliness. The
study was longitudinal and prospective and included baseline assessment and
6-year follow-up. After baseline assessment of 227 cognitively intact nursing
home residents (Clinical Dementia Rating score ≤0.5), 52 respondents were
interviewed a second time at the 5-year follow-up and 18 respondents a third time
at the 6-year follow-up. Data from the interviews were recorded using a global
question of loneliness, the Social Provisions Scale, Sense of Coherence Scale,
and Geriatric Depression Scale. Scores on Groll's index (p = .02) and the Sense
of Coherence Scale (p = .04) were positively correlated with loneliness and
negatively correlated with geriatric depression (p = .001). Having a diagnosis of
cancer, social support, and age were not correlated with loneliness 6 years from 
baseline. Loneliness did not change during the 6 years of follow-up, and symptoms
of depression and the sense of coherence appeared to be important components of
loneliness. Finally, having a diagnosis of cancer and social support were not
associated with loneliness.

Narrative identity in borderline personality disorder.

(1)Department of Psychology.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe psychiatric condition that is
associated with functional impairment and pathological traits. It has been argued
that identity impairment is one of the core features of BPD, which can be
manifested in different ways, including fragmented autobiographical narratives.
Here, we considered both the traditional and modern conceptualizations of BPD to 
examine the relation between identity impairment, as operationalized through
autobiographical memory, and features of BPD. We hypothesized that BPD features
would be associated with higher levels of fragmentation in narrative identity,
narrative intimacy, and narrative coherence in participants' autobiographical
memory. To test this hypothesis, we recruited 298 university students who were
administered a series of self-report measures of BPD and were asked to describe
an autobiographical memory about a turning point in their lives. Narrative
identity, but not narrative intimacy nor coherence, was the dominant predictor of
BPD features. We discuss our findings in terms of how individuals with features
of BPD struggle with many aspects of a distorted sense of self. (PsycInfo

Most studies about infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices are often
perceived as an individual choice depending on mothers' or caregivers' knowledge 
or attitudes and are focused on mothers' failure rather than successes in
adequately feeding their children. However, the role of life course experiences
in IYCF is less investigated. Applying a Salutogenic Model of Health, this study 
on 14 mothers looks at women's life course learning experiences shaping
appropriate IYCF practices during the first year of child's life in a rural
district of Rwanda. Transcripts from in-depth interviews were analysed using
thematic analysis. Results indicate that positive social interaction with parents
or grandmothers during childhood such as sharing meals, parental role models for 
dietary choices and cooking skills gained by participating in household food
preparation played a role in shaping appropriate IYCF practices. Negative
experiences during childhood also had a positive influence on IYCF practices for 
some participants by converting life course constraints into learning
opportunities. Motherhood increased mothers' sense of responsibility over their
children's health and nutrition. Moreover, mothers' participation in community
cooking classes and role modelling approach were strong avenues that enabled
their learning through positive interactions and encouragement. Nutrition
promotion interventions should consider tailoring nutrition advice to the
complexity of mothers' life course experiences by creating opportunities for
positive learning experiences of appropriate IYCF practices.

Background: Professional caregivers in youth residential care institutions
experience frequent verbal and physical aggression as well as multiple stressors 
as part of their everyday work, leading to high levels of burnout and staff
turnover. Resilience might buffer against psychophysiological stress response and
therefore be crucial for well-being in professional caregivers. Objectives: We
aimed to investigate if measures related to resilience [sense of coherence (SoC),
self-efficacy and self-care] and attachment security of caregivers were
cross-sectionally associated with stress markers in hair samples [cortisol and
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)]. Method: Participants (n = 134; 64.2% women)
reported on individual resilience measures and provided hair samples for cortisol
and DHEA assays. Attachment was assessed in a subsample using the Adult
Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP, n = 69). Linear regression models were
fitted to estimate the association between resilience measures and the
Cortisol:DHEA ratio, cortisol and DHEA, controlling for gender and age. Results: 
SoC was associated with a lower Cortisol:DHEA ratio (β = -0.36, p < 0.001),
driven by a positive association between SoC and DHEA levels (β = 0.28, p =
0.002). Self-care was also associated with lower Cortisol:DHEA ratios (β = -0.24,
p = 0.005), due to self-care being associated with higher DHEA (β = 0.21, p =
0.016). HPA-axis measures were not associated with self-efficacy nor with
attachment patterns in a subsample. Conclusions: Our findings imply that youth
residential care institutions might benefit from programs focusing on enhancing
SoC and self-care practices. Fostering a meaningful, comprehensible and
manageable professional climate in caregiving environments and implementing
self-care in routine practices might enhance not only well-being but also
physical health of professional caregivers and in this way buffer adverse health 
effects of chronic stressors.

Minority stress processes represent clear determinants of social anxiety among
sexual minority populations. Yet sources of resilience to social anxiety are less
explored as are stressors experienced from within sexual minority communities
(i.e., intraminority stress). Based on minority stress theory and the
psychological mediation framework, we hypothesized that experiences of
discrimination and intraminority stress would predict proximal minority stress
processes, including internalized homonegativity, sexual concealment behavior,
and rejection sensitivity, as well as two resilience factors-sense of coherence
and LGBTQ community connectedness-to explain social anxiety among sexual minority
individuals. Self-identified cisgender sexual minority women (n = 245) and men
(n = 256) residing in the Republic of Ireland completed an online survey. Results
from a structural equation modeling analysis indicated that the data fit the
hypothesized model well for both women and men. For both sexual minority women
and men, experiences of discrimination and intraminority stress were indirectly
associated with social anxiety via two paths (1) increased rejection sensitivity 
and (2) reduced sense of coherence. Intraminority stress was indirectly
associated with social anxiety via increased concealment behavior for sexual
minority men only. Experiences of discrimination were indirectly associated with 
social anxiety via a sequential pathway through increased proximal minority
stress (i.e., concealment behavior and internalized homonegativity), and reduced 
LGBTQ community connectedness solely among sexual minority women. Findings are
discussed in terms of implications for future research and clinical practice with
sexual minority individuals who suffer from social anxiety.

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε, catechol-O-methytranferase (COMT) Val108/158Met and
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) were shown to affect stress perception and response. The present study
explored possible associations between these SNPs and changes in subclinical
anxiety- and depressive symptoms, sense of coherence (SOC) and vital exhaustion
(VE) during compulsory basic military training. The study encompassed 179
conscripts of a training base in Greece. The neuropsychiatric assessment was
based on the Beck Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the
Antonovsky SOC scale and the Maastricht Questionnaire. It was conducted at three 
time points of the 19-day basic military training: on day one (baseline), day six
(follow-up I) and day 13 (follow-up II). Statistical analyses included
Mann-Whitney test, Chi-square test and cross-sectional time series regression
models based on the Skillings-Mack statistic. APOE ε4 non-carriers encountered
significant changes in anxiety- and depressive symptoms and SOC (in all cases
P < 0.001) over the observation period, whilst ε4 carriers did not. The changes
in anxiety, depressive symptoms and SOC attained statistical significance in both
BDNF Met66 carriers (in all cases P < 0.001) and non-carriers
(P = 0.036; < 0.001; < 0.001, respectively) as well as in COMT Met108/158
carriers (P = 0.004; < 0.001; < 0.001, respectively) and non-carriers (P = 0.02; 
0.01; 0.021, respectively. Changes over time in VE were not significant
(P > 0.05). The observed resistance of APOE ε4 carriers vs non-carriers to
changes in anxiety- and depressive symptoms and SOC when exposed to a stressful
environment may point to superior coping capacities of healthy young men carrying
the ε4 allele.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an important impact on the academic world. It is
known that university studies can influence the mental health of students, and
especially those studying health sciences. In this study, we therefore sought to 
analyse whether the current pandemic has affected the mental well-being of
final-year nursing students. This was a multi-centre study, with a descriptive,
longitudinal, and prospective design. Mental well-being was evaluated using the
General Health Questionnaire. A total of 305 participants were included in the
study, of whom 52.1% had experienced the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistically
significant differences were found between the two groups analysed in terms of
age, access to university, average marks, mental well-being self-esteem,
emotional exhaustion, and sense of coherence. In the case of mental well-being, a
direct association was found with both the pandemic situation (OR = 2.32,
P = 0.010) and emotional exhaustion scores (OR = 1.20, P < 0.001), while an
inverse association was found with sense of coherence scores (OR = 0.45,
P < 0.001). This study shows that the mental health of students is a significant 
factor and one that must be taken into consideration when training nursing staff 
at university. There is a need to promote healthy habits and provide appropriate 
coping strategies. It is also important to train and prepare students for
pandemic situations as these can have an important impact on the mental health of
both the members of the public who will be treated by these future nursing
professionals and the students themselves.

Objective: The population of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) is growing
in Mexico and the United States, and there is an increasing need for family
members to provide caregiving. This study examined the connections between family
dynamics and coping, or sense of coherence, among PD caregivers in Mexico
(n = 148) and the United States (n = 105).
Methods: Caregivers completed measures of family dynamics and sense of coherence 
across indices of comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness.
Results: Although caregivers in Mexico and the United States had similar levels
of sense of coherence and family dynamics reflecting strengths/adaptability and
being overwhelmed with difficulties, caregivers in Mexico had worse disrupted
communication. Family dynamics explained: 24.2% of the variance in caregiver
comprehensibility in the United States and 17.5% in Mexico; 34.1% in
manageability in the United States and 23.5% in Mexico; and 22.6% in
meaningfulness in the United States and 22.7% in Mexico (all Ps < 0.001). In both
Mexico and the United States, family strengths/adaptability uniquely predicted
caregiver comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness. Being overwhelmed
with difficulties uniquely predicted comprehensibility in Mexico and
manageability and meaningfulness in the United States.
Conclusion: The development of family-systems interventions for PD caregivers to 
improve family strengths/adaptability and help families deal with difficulties
may increase caregiver coping.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can experience obstacles in traditional health
care situations due to difficulties associated with their impairment.
OBJECTIVE: This controlled study aims to investigate the feasibility of an
internet-based support and coaching intervention (IBSC), including 2 weekly chat 
sessions and 2 complementary clinic visits with coaches over the course of 8
weeks, for adolescents and young adults with ADHD and/or ASD in 2 naturalistic
routine care settings.
METHODS: Individuals with ADHD and/or ASD aged 15-32 years were recruited in 2
clinical settings, where they received either IBSC (n=24) or treatment as usual
(TAU; n=20). Outcome measures included self-report questionnaires assessing
quality of life (Manchester Short Assessment for Quality of Life), sense of
coherence (Sense Of Coherence 29), self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), and
anxiety and depressive symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS] and
Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale-Self-reported, respectively).
RESULTS: Significant between-group effects were observed in measures of anxiety
(HADS) at postintervention (P=.02) as well as at the 6-month follow-up (P=.004). 
Significant between-group effects were also noted for depressive symptoms (HADS) 
postintervention (P=.04). The between-group effects were partially explained by a
deterioration in the TAU group. A significant increase in self-esteem (P=.04) as 
well as a decrease in anxiety (P=.003) at the 6-month follow-up was observed in
the intervention group following IBSC. Findings from a qualitative study of the
intervention are consistent with the results.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study suggest that IBSC holds promise as a
feasible complement or alternative to traditional face-to-face health care
meetings.

OBJECTIVE: The need to make sense of coherence in placement support for student
dental hygienists has been shown. On this basis, this study investigated the
relationship between the sense of coherence of student dental hygienists and
their view of the profession and attitude to work in order to clarify how they
perceive their prospects for employment.
METHODS: The subjects were graduation-year students at all of the dental
hygienist training institutions in Japan, and anonymous, self-administered
questionnaires were sent to the institutions by post in 2019. The results were
analyzed by χ2 tests, as well as one-way analysis of variance and multiple
comparisons using Tukey's test, with the level of significance set at 5%.
RESULTS: Of 6270 questionnaires that were returned, 6264 were analyzed. The sense
of coherence (SOC) component senses were manageability (F(26,221) = 5306.06, p < 
0.01), meaningfulness (F(26,222) = 4373.48, p < 0.01), and comprehensibility
(F(26,216) = 3986.12, p < 0.01), with meaningfulness scoring significantly higher
than the other two (p < 0.01). Analysis with SOC scores divided into the low,
medium, and high groups showed a relationship between the SOC of student dental
hygienists and their view of the profession and attitude to work (p < 0.01), such
that higher SOC scores were associated with a better view of the profession and a
better attitude to work (F(26,225) = 282.18, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that education that increases SOC in dental
hygienist training programs may positively affect future prospects for student
dental hygienists.

Sport science librarianship = health science librarianship?

Haglund L.

Does sports science librarianship differ from other aspects of health
librarianship? Or are sports science librarians more likely to identify as
generalist librarians? This editorial introduces the salutogenic approach to
sport, factors that support human health and well-being, and highlights the
challenge of resourcing the diversity of subjects covered by sports sciences.
Highlighting key parallels with medicine and public health, it concludes by
advocating for closer alignment between sports and health science librarianship.

Background: The efficacy of vision screening for adults has not been well
established. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of
vision-threatening ocular diseases, including glaucoma, among subjects who
participated in specific health checkups in Japan.
Methods: This cross-sectional study included 1360 individuals who underwent
comprehensive ophthalmic examinations at 16 ophthalmology clinics located in
three municipalities. We surveyed the study participants using a questionnaire.
The participants also underwent visual acuity and refraction tests, intraocular
pressure tests, slit-lamp microscopy, fundus examinations, fundus photography,
optical coherence tomography, and static perimetry.
Results: The mean age of the subjects was 63.7 ± 8.7 years (range, 40-74 years). 
Among the 1360 participants, 168 (12.4%) were diagnosed with glaucoma and 33
(2.4%) with preperimetric glaucoma. Cataracts were seen in 741 participants
(54.5%), and 77 (5.7%) were diagnosed with clinically significant cataracts.
Retinal diseases included macular degeneration (1.2%), diabetic retinopathy
(1.0%), chorioretinal atrophy (0.5%), macular epiretinal membrane (2.9%), branch 
retinal vein occlusion (0.7%), and others (2.0%). Regarding the type of glaucoma,
93.5% of participants with glaucoma were diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma in a 
broad sense (81.0% with normal-tension glaucoma and 12.5% with primary open-angle
glaucoma). Multivariate analysis showed that male sex, age, systemic
comorbidities, and myopia were significant risk factors for open-angle glaucoma.
Conclusion: Many adults with ocular diseases were screened by ophthalmic
checkups. The addition of simultaneous ophthalmic checkups to specific health
checkups could be an effective measure for the prevention of visual impairment in
the older population.

BACKGROUND: Extensive research describes how nurses experience their work
environment. The conditions are described as stressful and dissatisfying with
nurses intending to leave their workplace. Knowledge about the personal
perception regarding why nurses consider leaving the hospital workplace is
limited. The purpose of this study was to understand why hospital nurses remain
in their workplace, which facilitates their continuation in the profession.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to explore and describe factors explaining why
hospital nurses remain in the workplace.
METHODS: This was a descriptive qualitative study with a purposive sample of
hospital nurses in Sweden. The salutogenic theory was the basis for the interview
guide and the semi-structured questions. Individual interviews were conducted in 
a hospital in western Sweden. Content analysis was performed to organize the
coded data according to the sense of coherence.
RESULTS: Data saturation was achieved with 12 interviews. Within the three themes
of coherence (comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness), ten
subthemes were categorized from the data as follows: job satisfaction and fun at 
work, acknowledgement and productivity, togetherness and team security,
manageable workload, variable work and challenging situations, workplace and
personal space balance, collaboration and supportive leadership, valued role and 
good work, commitment and involvement, and pride in the professional role.
CONCLUSIONS: The main findings of this study have shown the critical importance
of being in a meaningful, comprehensible and manageable work context that
supports nurses in maintaining their professional identity.

Sulforaphane (SFN) is a sulfur-containing isothiocyanate found in cruciferous
vegetables (Brassicaceae) and a well-known activator of nuclear factor-erythroid 
2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), considered a master regulator of cellular antioxidant 
responses. Patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, cancer, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) present with high levels of
oxidative stress and a massive inflammatory burden associated with diminished
Nrf2 and elevated nuclear transcription factor-κB-κB expression. Because it is a 
common constituent of dietary vegetables, the salutogenic properties of
sulforaphane, especially it's antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties,
have been explored as a nutritional intervention in a range of diseases of
ageing, though data on CKD remain scarce. In this brief review, the effects of
SFN as a senotherapeutic agent are described and a rationale is provided for
studies that aim to explore the potential benefits of SFN-rich foods in patients 
with CKD.

Background: Many studies indicate that men are more reluctant to seek help for
mental health problems than women. Traditional ideas of masculinity are often
seen as a cause of this phenomenon. However, little is known about the diversity 
of experiences during the processes of help-seeking and service use among men
with depression who have already utilized mental health services. This study aims
to explore men's experiences and attitudes toward depression, help-seeking, and
service use in order to develop gender-sensitive services. Methods:
Narrative-biographical interviews were conducted with men treated for depression 
(n = 12). Interview topics included individual experience with depression,
help-seeking behavior, and mental health service use. Transcripts were analyzed
using qualitative content analysis. Results: Before seeking treatment, men's
help-seeking behavior was negatively affected by internalized masculine norms.
However, findings indicate a change of attitudes toward depression after mental
health service use. Men with depression emphasized a salutogenic perspective
toward mental health problems and critically reflected on masculine norms. The
positive function of men-only groups were described as key for successful service
use. Conclusions: Men with depression reported experiences toward help-seeking
and service use on four different levels: (i) attitudes toward depression, (ii)
perception of societal views on depression, (iii) experiences within the family
context and (iv) experiences with mental health services. Interventions to reduce
the stigma of being "unmanly" and to improve men's capacity to cope with being
unable to work should be developed. Peer-led men-only groups may increase
participants' self-esteem and assist in disclosing weaknesses. In the context of 
GPs' mediating role, training for health professionals concerning the impact of
masculine norms on mental health is recommended.

University, Malmö, Sweden.

OBJECTIVES: The area of regenerative work is still close to unexplored. The aim
was to explore the possibility for employees to gain energy at work.
METHODS: Questionnaire to all employees (n = 599) from different professions in
public and private primary health care centers in one health care district in
Sweden. The questionnaire, which had a salutogenic perspective, included
information on self-rated health, psychosocial work environment and experiences, 
recovery, social climate, and energy. Having an energy-building experience was
defined by a positive response to two combined questions regarding energy at
work. Analyses were performed with bivariate correlation and multiple logistic
regression.
RESULTS: The response rate was 84%. Health and energy correlated positively (r = 
0.54). In total, 44.5% of the employees reported having an energy-building
experience. Predictors for having an energy-building experience were recovery
[positive odds ratio (POR) = 2.78], autonomy (POR = 2.26), positive workplace
characteristics (POR = 2.09), and internal work experiences (POR = 1.88).
CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis that it is possible to gain
energy at work, an area that is still close to unexplored. There is a high
correlation between energy and health. Employees' energy-building experiences
relate to well-being at work and correlates to recovery, autonomy, positive
workplace characteristics, and positive internal work experiences. This knowledge
can help in improving future work environment development.

We examine the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and concomitant restrictions
(i.e., lockdown) on 24-hour movement behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sitting,
sleep) in a purposive sample of people (n = 3230) reporting change recruited
online. Participants' self-reported time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity (MVPA), walking, sitting and sleep prior to lockdown (T1), during the
first national lockdown (T2) and as restrictions initially started to ease (T3). 
For each 24-hour movement behavior, category-shifts are reported (positive,
negative or did not change), as well as the percentage of participants recording 
positive/negative changes across clusters of behaviors and the percentage of
participants recording improvement or maintenance of change across time. From T1 
to T2 walking decreased, whereas MVPA, sitting and sleep increased, from T2 to T3
levels returned to pre-lockdown for all but MVPA. Participants who changed one
behavior positively were more likely to report a positive change in another and
50% of those who reported positive changes from T1 to T2 maintained or improved
further when restrictions started to ease. The current study showed that a large 
proportion of the sample reported positive changes, most notably those displaying
initially poor levels of each behavior. These findings will inform salutogenic
intervention development.

Erratum in
    Work. 2021;68(2):519.

BACKGROUND: Researchers suggest that physiotherapists are highly exposed to both 
the physical and the mental strains.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess mood and the level of stress as
well as a sense of coherence among future physiotherapists studying at the
Department of Physiotherapy.
METHODS: The study included 249 students, 181 women and 68 men. The Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI), the Sense of Coherence Questionnaire (SOC-29) and the
Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) were used.
RESULTS: The examined group had an average level of sense of coherence and a low 
level of stress. One out of four students exhibited mood disorders. The factors
associated with the prevalence of mood disorders among studied students were as
follows: female (gender), lack of regular physical activity, poor financial
situation, lack of friend to talk to in case of problems, dissatisfaction with
the chosen field of study, and being inadequately prepared to work as a
physiotherapist.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study indicate an increased prevalence of mood
disorders among students of physiotherapy. It is suggested that this situation
may require the implementation of effective psychoprophylactic activities during 
the course of studies and broadly understood education about the psychophysical
wellbeing of students, especially as they will work in an environment that
requires high resistance to stress and support for other people in a crisis

The purpose of this exploratory research was to understand the experiences and
learnings of dietetic and nutrition students following a 3-week intensive summer 
course designed to enhance students' understandings of compassion, creativity,
and sense of coherence as they apply to personal growth and socially just
professional practice. Seven of 15 students participated in one-on-one,
semi-structured interviews. Data analysis was conducted using inductive thematic 
analysis, resulting in 3 meta-themes: (i) personal meaning and sense making, (ii)
relational and power dynamics, and (iii) disruption; participants contextualized 
these themes via a dynamic interplay within and among the domains of self,
pedagogy, and practice. As a result of taking this course, participants developed
an enhanced sense of coherence, self-compassion, well-being, and a more
equity-focused understanding of health. Student development may have been
achieved through attending to student experience and a relational pedagogical
epistemology that allowed students to make personal, interpersonal, and systemic 
connections among their own subjective experiences, the experiences of peers, and
broader social impacts on health. Given nutrition classrooms are largely
positivist, it is important to consider how these environments as relational
contexts may support or undermine compassion, sense of coherence, and ultimately 
the health and well-being of students.

This study aimed to develop and evaluate the effects of a Salutogenic program on 
sense of coherence, depression, and suicidal ideation among rural older adults.
Quasi-experimental, nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design was used.
Participants were female, aged 65 years and older from G and O province, South
Korea. The experimental group (n = 22) received a 12-session Salutogenic program 
for 6 weeks, twice a week. The control group (n = 19) was put on a waiting list
to receive the intervention after completing the study. Collected data were
analyzed using descriptive statistics, a χ2 test, independent t-test, and
repeated measure ANOVA with SPSS WIN 26.0. There were significant differences in 
sense of coherence (F = 19.34, p < .001), depression (F = 12.93, p < .001), and
suicidal ideation (F = 4.40, p = .027) over time pretest, posttest, and follow-up
test after intervention between two groups. The study discussed the effect of
Salutogenic program on sense of coherence, depression, and suicidal ideation, and
considered its benefits in suicide prevention for elderly women. The Salutogenic 
program can be recommended as useful strategies to enhance sense of coherence and
to reduce depression and suicidal ideation of elderly women in community.

The original aim of this study was a follow-up assessment of a recreational
program running for six months (September 2019-February 2020) within controlled
conditions. Following the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey acquired a
new goal: how do the subjects of the follow-up sampling experience this severe
stress situation, and in this experience, what role does physical activity and a 
salutogenetic sense of coherence play. Austrian women (N = 53) took part in the
training program, whose physical condition was assessed before the start of the
program, then reassessed after three months and after six months; the organizers 
also had them fill out the sense of coherence questionnaire (SOC) as well as the 
Regensburger insomnia scale. After the lifting of the lockdown introduced due to 
the pandemic, participants completed an online survey relating to their changed
life conditions, physical activities, sense of coherence and sleep quality.
Results: After the first three months of the training, no significant changes
were detected. After six months, the participants SOC and sleep quality improved 
(Friedman test: p = 0.005 and p < 0.001). During the lockdown, sleep quality
generally deteriorated (W-rank test: p = 0.001), while SOC did not change. The
women in possession of a relatively stronger SOC continued the training (OR =
3.6, CI 95% = 1.2-12.2), and their sleep quality deteriorated to a lesser degree.
(OR = 1.7, CI 95% = 1.1-2.8). Conclusion: The data reinforce the interdependency 
between physical exercise (PE) and SOC; furthermore, the personal training that
the authors formulated for middle-aged women proved to be successful in
strengthening their sense of coherence, and it also reduced the deterioration in 
sleep quality due to stress.

Maintaining and promoting teachers' work ability is essential for increasing
productivity and preventing early exit from the teaching profession. This study
aimed to identify the predictors of work ability among upper-secondary school
teachers and examine the mediating role of burnout. A large and diverse group of 
Czech upper-secondary school teachers was surveyed to address this goal. The
sample comprised 531 upper-secondary school teachers (50.0 ± 9.94 years, 19.9 ±
10.62 in the teaching profession, 57.6% females). Relatively greater empirical
support was found for the effects of burnout, sense of coherence, work-life
balance, and perceived relationships in the school environment on work ability
than for the impact of age, homeroom teacher duties, workload, and caring for
elderly relatives. Furthermore, burnout served as an important mediator of the
relationship between sense of coherence and work ability. Teachers with a higher 
sense of coherence are thus better able to cope with adverse work circumstances
and identify and mobilize internal and external resources to prevent professional
exhaustion and the subsequent decline in work ability. The study can guide
interventions on the work ability of teachers.

Relationships and trust: Two key pillars of a well-functioning freestanding
midwifery unit.

Author information:

City, University of London, London, UK.

BACKGROUND: Despite strong evidence supporting the expansion of midwife-led unit 
provision, as a result of optimal maternal and perinatal outcomes,
cost-effectiveness, and positive service user and staff experiences, scaling-up
has been slow. Systemic barriers associated with gender, professional, economic, 
cultural, and social factors continue to constrain the expansion of midwifery as 
a public health intervention globally. This article aimed to explore
relationships and trust as key components of a well-functioning freestanding
midwifery unit (FMU).
METHOD(S): A critical realist ethnographic study of an FMU located in East
London, England, was conducted over a period of 15 months. Recruitment of the 82 
participants was purposive. Data collection included participant observation and 
semi-structured interviews, and data were analyzed thematically along with
relevant local guidelines and documents.
RESULTS: Twelve themes emerged. Relationships and Trust were identified as a core
theme. The other 11 themes were grouped into six families, three of which:
Ownership, Autonomy, and Continuous Learning; Team Spirit, Interdependency, and
Power Relations; and Salutogenesis will be covered in this paper. The remaining
three families: Friendly Environment; Having Time and Mindfulness; and Social
Capital, will be covered in a separate paper.
CONCLUSIONS: A relationship-based model of care was crucial for both the
functioning of the FMU and service users' satisfaction and may offer a compelling
response to high levels of stress and burnout among midwives.

Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland, New
Zealand.

AIMS: This systematic review sought to synthesize the evidence regarding the
effectiveness of illness perception interventions compared with control
conditions at changing illness perceptions and improving glycaemic control in
individuals with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: Seven electronic databases were searched between October 2018 and May
2020. Randomized controlled trials that tested interventions informed by the
Common-Sense Model in adults with type 2 diabetes, and measured illness
perceptions and glycaemic control at pre- and post-intervention were included.
The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess risk of bias.
RESULTS: A total of 4095 articles were identified, of which nine randomized
control trials (2561 participants) across 12 publications were included in this
review. Findings showed that all the illness perception domains were modified in 
at least one trial, with the exception of cyclical timeline perceptions.
Coherence, personal control, treatment control and chronic timeline perceptions
were the most frequently modified perceptions. Glycaemic control demonstrated an 
improvement in the intervention group compared to the control group at 3 and
6 months post-intervention in two trials. Risk of bias assessment showed high
risk of bias especially for the blinding of participants and the personnel
domain.
CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence that interventions informed by the
Common-Sense Model can improve glycaemic control in individuals with type 2
diabetes through changing inaccurate illness perceptions. Recommendations for
future research are to tailor intervention content based on baseline perceptions,
measure the emotional and causal domains, and involve family members in the
intervention. (PROSPERO registration: CRD42019114532).

BACKGROUND: Research on the relationship between resilience and loneliness is
sparse. The construct of resilience has been conceptualized in multiple ways,
including the measurement of resilience. The Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) is
a measure of protective factors. The present study examined whether resiliency
moderates any negative relationship between loneliness and mental health and
additionally examined the psychometric properties of the Danish translation of
the RSA.
METHODS: A Danish sample (N = 422) completed the UCLA Loneliness Scale, Hopkins
Symptom Check List-25 (HSCL-25), the Sense of Coherence (SOC-13), and the RSA,
Resilience Scale for Adults.
RESULTS: The measure of loneliness correlated significantly and negatively with
most facets of the RSA, except the subscales of family cohesion and structured
style. The strongest correlation was the negative one between loneliness and SOC.
The results indicated that people feeling lonely also experience their life as
less meaningful.
CONCLUSION: The study supports the existing six-factor structure of the
Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) in a Danish sample. The results indicate that
all facets of resiliency were negatively related to loneliness. Also, the facets 
of perception of self and family coherence could explain a substantial amount of 
the variance associated with symptoms of depression in relation to loneliness.

Background: In the military context, high levels of physiological and
psychological stress together can compromise individual's ability to complete
given duty or mission and increase dropout rates. The purpose of this study was
to investigate if baseline physical fitness, body composition, hormonal and
psychological factors could predict dropout from a 10-day intense winter military
survival training. Methods: 69 conscripts volunteered to participate in the
study. Physical fitness (muscle strength and power, muscle endurance, and aerobic
fitness), body composition and hormonal variables (BDNF, testosterone, cortisol, 
SHBG, DHEAS, IGF-1) together with self-reported psychological factors (short five
personality, hardiness, sense of coherence, stress, depression) were assessed
prior the survival training. Results: During the survival training, 20 conscripts
(29%) dropped out. Baseline aerobic fitness (hazard ratio, HR: 0.997, 95% CI:
0.994-0.999, p = 0.006) and serum cortisol (HR: 1.0006, 95% CI: 1.001-1.011, p = 
0.017) predicted dropout in Cox regression model. Each 10 m increase in the 12
min running test decreased the risk for dropout by 3%. Conclusion: Although most 
of the physiological and psychological variables at the baseline did not predict 
dropout during a short-term winter survival military training, baseline
information of aerobic fitness and serum cortisol concentration may be useful to 
target support for individuals at higher potential risk for dropout.

This study aimed to investigate if proposed restorative attributes according to
attention restoration theory and supportive environment theory could be
experienced and identified in Icelandic landscape and contribute to a restorative
experience in nature sites in rural Iceland. A prospective mixed-method study was
conducted over the period of one year. Seven different nature sites that were
considered likely to have restorative qualities were selected for the evaluation 
i.e., three forest sites, three seashores, and one park in and in the vicinity of
Ísafjör&eth;ur, Iceland. Each site was evaluated regarding how the participants
experienced its restorative qualities and how a stay therein affected their
mental state. Nature visits were offered once a week, where the participants
visited one of the seven locations for two hours. The findings show that the
participants perceived and experienced nature sites as having the characteristics
of a restorative environment and that staying at the nature sites positively
affected their mental state. External conditions, like weather, which can affect 
nature visits, were rarely a hinderance. Thus, it can be concluded that numerous 
coastal areas, forests, and parks in Iceland, especially in rural areas, might
possess restorative qualities as well. This result shows that wild and open
nature in North West Iceland has the characteristics of a restorative environment
and can be utilized for health promotion.

Mental disorders are a core health challenge in the 21st century. Integrative
mental health care takes an individual, lifestyle-modifying, salutogenic
approach, combining somatic, psychosocial, and spiritual perspectives from
evidence-based conventional and complementary medicine. In particular, meditation
and mindfulness have received growing research interest in the last decade. In
this article, we present Meditation-Based Lifestyle Modification (MBLM), a new,
complex mind-body intervention for mental health care. It is the first program to
intensify meditation practice using classical yoga. The program (a) covers all
areas of classical yoga, (b) considers ethical and spiritual aspects of daily
life, (c) orients participants toward sustained lifestyle modification, and (d)
is applicable in a clinical context. The scientific rationale of the program is
outlined in this article, based on the Criteria for Reporting the Development and
Evaluation of Complex Interventions in Healthcare. Further research is planned to
show the clinical feasibility of MBLM and evaluate its efficacy, processes of
change, and cost-effectiveness.

INTRODUCTION: Maternal-fetal attachment is a term used to describe the emotional 
relationship that a pregnant woman has with her developing fetus. Mental care for
pregnant women (fear of childbirth and a sense of cohesion of pregnant women) is 
one of the most important aspects of prenatal care that affects the mother's
attachment to the fetus. If fear and anxiety are relieved, psychological and
physical relaxation will be replaced. Therefore, the present study was conducted 
with the aim of determining the relationship between fear of childbirth and the
sense of cohesion with the attachment of pregnant mothers to the fetus.
METHODS: The present study is a descriptive study that was performed by
multi-stage sampling method on 500 pregnant mothers who referred to health
centers in Isfahan in 2017. The study participants completed the following
questionnaires: fear of childbirth, sense of cohesion, and mother's attachment to
the fetus. The data were analyzed by descriptive and analytical statistical
methods (Pearson correlation) using SPSS software version 22.
RESULTS: The results showed that there was a significant negative relationship
between the overall score of maternal attachment to the fetus and fear of
childbirth (r = -0.153, P = 0.001). However, there is a significant positive
relationship between the overall score of maternal attachment to the fetus and
the sense of cohesion (r = 0.112, P = 0.01). The results also showed a
significant negative relationship between the fear of childbirth and the
dimensions of maternal attachment to the fetus, including interaction with the
fetus (P = 0.04), self-sacrifice (P = 0.04), and attributing characteristics to
the fetus (P = 0.05). There was a positive and significant relationship between
the sense of coherence and the subsequent acceptance of the maternal role of
maternal attachment to the fetus (P = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: More attention of prenatal care provider to the psychological issues 
of the pregnant mother and their fears and worries can lead to appropriate
interventions in this field, and as a result, mothers' attachment to their fetus 
has increased so that they can take proper care during and after pregnancy.

AIMS: To determine changes in OHRQoL and clinical status after periodontal
treatment and the factors predicting these changes.
METHODS: Cohort of 140 patients with chronic periodontitis receiving non-surgical
treatment. Participant self-completed questionnaires: Sense of Coherence, Locus
of Control, Self-esteem and Task-specific Self-efficacy before treatment, and
Oral Health Impact Profile at treatment, oral hygiene review and end of study.
Relationships between OHRQoL, clinical data, individual and environmental
characteristics were analysed with structural equation modelling guided by the
Wilson and Cleary model.
RESULTS: OHRQoL and the periodontal status improved after treatment. Greater
sense of coherence and age, better periodontal status, lower DMFT and being male 
predicted better OHRQoL after treatment. Better task-specific self-efficacy and
self-esteem, but worse plaque score predicted better end periodontal status.
CONCLUSIONS: OHRQoL and periodontal status improved after periodontal treatment, 
and this was predicted by individual demographic and psychological factors. These
factors may assist with case selection and as possible points for intervention to
improve clinical and subjective outcomes of periodontal treatment.

Misinterpretations during language comprehension are common. The ability to
recover from processing difficulties is therefore crucial for successful
day-to-day communication. Previous research on the recovery from
misinterpretations has focused on sentences containing syntactic ambiguities. The
present study instead investigated the outcome of comprehension processes and
online reading behavior when misinterpretations occurred due to lexical-semantic 
ambiguity. Ninety-six adult participants read "garden-path" sentences in which an
ambiguous word was disambiguated toward an unexpected meaning (e.g., "The ball
was crowded"), while their eye movements were monitored. A meaning coherence
judgment task required them to decide whether or not each sentence made sense.
Results suggested that readers did not always engage in reinterpretation
processes but instead followed a "good enough" processing strategy. Successful
detection of a violation of sentence coherence and associated reinterpretation
processes also required additional processing time compared to sentences that did
not induce a misinterpretation. Although these reinterpretation-related
processing costs were relatively stable across individuals, there was some
evidence to suggest that readers with greater lexical expertise benefited from
greater sensitivity to the disambiguating information, and were able to flexibly 
adapt their online reading behavior to recover from misinterpretations more
efficiently. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

COVID-19 has brought tremendous and abrupt threats to various aspects of our
daily lives, from school and work to interpersonal relationships. Self-compassion
is put forth as a salutogenic perspective on oneself that buffers the adverse
mental health impacts of these threats. During the peak of a local outbreak in
Hong Kong in Spring 2020, 761 participants completed questionnaires on
self-compassion, perceived threats, as well as perceived benefits and
psychological distress. Controlling for demographic variables, negative
indicators of self-compassion (aka self-coldness) was found to intensify the
impacts of threats on psychological distress. The positive indicators of
self-compassion also moderated the link between threats and perceived benefits,
such that perceived benefits tend to be less related to threats in participants
with higher self-compassion. Our findings highlight the impacts of both positive 
and negative indicators of self-compassion on the adjustment to such
unprecedented challenges, and point to the possibility of enhancing people's
resilience through fostering self-compassion and alleviating self-coldness.

PURPOSE: For some years now, a programme for the use of integrative care in
paediatric oncology has been established in a German university hospital and
offers patients and parents complementary treatment options. According to their
medical condition and wishes. A variety of external applications such as medical 
wraps, warm oil compresses and rhythmic embrocations are offered. This article
analyses how patients and parents perceived and experienced the integrative care 
program.
METHODS: In this qualitative study, data consists of field notes conducted
through participant observation, informal conversations and interviews with
parents (n = 25) during the implementation phase of the program. Data was
analysed on basis of thematic analysis and organized with the analysis software
MAXQDA.
RESULTS: Parents and families intuitively developed strategies for dealing with
crisis situations such as childhood cancer. In addition, many of the families
brought with them a wealth of experience in complementary medicine. Parents
perceived the integrative care treatments as soothing, relaxing and
pain-relieving for their child. Patients could relax and side effects of
chemotherapy were alleviated. However, children, who undergoing chemotherapy were
not always open for physical touch and thus sometimes also rejected the
treatments sometimes.
CONCLUSION: The analysed integrative care programme is perceived as a strong
patient and family-centred approach of support during the oncological paediatric 
treatment. From a salutogenetic viewpoint, this program aims to strengthen the
dimension of manageability within the concept of sense of coherence. Parents are 
given supportive means to manage side effects and ease their child's suffering,
through touch and attention that can be very beneficial.

BACKGROUND: This prospective, cross-sectional, observational study examined
associations between sense of coherence (SOC), mental well-being, and perceived
preoperative hospital and surgery related stress of surgical patients with
malignant, benign, and no neoplasms. The objective was to assess a putative
association between SOC and preoperative stress, and to test for a statistical
mediation by mental well-being.
METHOD: The sample consisted of 4918 patients from diverse surgical fields, of
which 945 had malignant neoplasms, 333 benign neoplasms, and 3640 no neoplasms.
For each subsample, we conducted simple mediation analyses to test an indirect
effect of SOC on preoperative stress mediated by mental well-being. The models
were adjusted for age, gender, and essential medical factors.
RESULTS: Patient groups did not differ significantly regarding degrees of SOC and
mental well-being (SOC, M [SD]: 12.31 [2.59], 12.02 [2.62], 12.18 [2.57]; mental 
well-being M [SD]: 59.26 [24.05], 56.89 [22.67], 57.31 [22.87], in patients with 
malignant, benign, and without neoplasms, respectively). Patients without
neoplasms reported significantly lower stress (4.19 [2.86], M [SD]) than those
with benign (5.02 [3.03], M [SD]) and malignant neoplasms (4.99 [2.93], M [SD]). 
In all three mediation models, SOC had significant direct effects on stress, with
higher SOC being associated with lower stress (- 0.3170 [0.0407], - 0.3484
[0.0752], - 0.2919 [0.0206]; c' [SE], p < 0.001 in patients with malignant,
benign, and without neoplasms, respectively). In patients with malignant
neoplasms and without neoplasms, SOC showed small indirect effects on stress that
were statistically mediated by well-being. Higher SOC was related to higher
well-being, which in turn was related to lower stress. In patients with benign
neoplasms, however, no significant indirect effects of SOC were found.
CONCLUSIONS: SOC was directly associated with lower perceived hospital and
surgery related stress, over and above the direct and mediation effects of mental
well-being. Because the data are cross-sectional, conclusions implying causality 
cannot be drawn. Nevertheless, they indicate important relationships that can
inform treatment approaches to reduce elevated preoperative stress by
specifically addressing low SOC.

The worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, the ensuing pandemic, and the related
containment measures pose considerable challenges to psychological resilience and
well-being. Researchers are now forced to look for resources to cope with
negative experiences linked to this health emergency. According to the
salutogenic approach proposed by Antonovsky, the sense of coherence (SOC) is a
major source of resilience. Thus, this study aimed at assessing the role of SOC
in moderating the link between illness experiences (in terms of knowing persons
diagnosed with COVID-19 and fear of contracting COVID-19) and psychological
well-being. 2,784 participants, taken from a large sample of the Italian
population (65.4% females) and aged between 18 and 85 years, filled in an
anonymous online survey during the 3rd week of the lockdown. Findings supported
the moderating role of SOC in shaping the link between illness experiences and
psychological well-being. Specifically, participants who knew at least one person
diagnosed with COVID-19 showed lower levels of psychological well-being at low
levels of SOC. The negative relation between participants' fear of contracting
COVID-19 and psychological well-being was stronger for those who showed higher
levels of SOC. This study discusses the implications of these results for
interventions aimed at reducing the pandemic's detrimental effects and promoting 
resilience.

Sense of coherence (SoC) is the origin of health according to Antonovsky. The
link between SoC and risk of cancer has however rarely been assessed. We
performed a cohort study of 46,436 women from the Karolinska Mammography Project 
for Risk Prediction of Breast Cancer (Karma). Participants answered a SoC-13
questionnaire at recruitment to Karma and were subsequently followed up for
incident breast cancer. Multivariate Cox models were used to assess the hazard
ratios (HRs) of breast cancer in relation to SoC. We identified 771 incident
cases of breast cancer during follow-up (median time: 5.2 years). No association 
was found between SoC, either as a categorical (strong vs. weak SoC, HR: 1.08,
95% CI: 0.90-1.29) or continuous (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.00-1.17 per standard
deviation increase of SoC) variable, and risk of breast cancer. In summary, we
found little evidence to support an association between SoC and risk of breast
cancer.

Preliminary data indicates that the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19)
pandemic may have a substantial impact on mental health and well-being. We
assessed mental health in response to the lockdown in Germany between 1 April
2020 and 15 April 2020 using a cross-sectional online survey (n = 3545) with a
mixed-methods approach. We found increased levels of psychosocial distress
(Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) stress module), anxiety, depressive symptoms 
(PHQ-4), irritability, and a decrease in overall well-being (WHO-Five Well-Being 
Index (WHO-5)), sense of coherence (Short Form of the Sense of Coherence Scale
(SOC-L9)), sexual contentment, and sleep quality. The four-week-prevalence of
interpersonal violence was yet at 5% and included verbal, physical, and sexual
violence. Participants reported finding comfort in family, friends, conversation,
exercise, and activity. Findings are also in line with research showing that
women seem to have more trouble coping with the pandemic and lockdown measures.
Our observations demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic and related measures lead
to a mental health burden even in a highly developed Western country and should, 
therefore, be taken seriously. The findings for interpersonal violence are
alarming. Thus, we should sharpen our focus on the matter and activate and
enhance supporting systems to help protect those affected.

Semiclassical mechanics allows for a description of quantum systems which
preserves their phase information, and thus interference effects, while using
only the system's classical dynamics as an input. In particular one of the
strengths of a semiclassical description is to present a coherent picture which
(to negligible higher-order ℏ corrections) is independent of the particular
canonical coordinates used. However, this coherence relies heavily on the use of 
the stationary phase approximation. It turns out, however, that in some important
cases, a brutal application of stationary phase approximation washes out all
interference, and thus quantum, effects. In this paper, we address this issue in 
detail in one of its simplest instantiations, namely the evaluation of the time
evolution of the expectation value of an operator. We explain why it is necessary
to include contributions which are not in the neighborhood of stationary points
and provide new semiclassical expressions for the evolution of the expectation
values. The efficiency of our approach is based on the fact that we treat
analytically all the integrals that can be performed within the stationary phase 
approximation, implying that the remaining integrals are simple integrals, in the
sense that the integrand has no significant variations on the quantum scale (and 
thus they are very easy to perform numerically). This to be contrasted with other
approaches such as the ones based on initial value representation, popular in
chemical and molecular physics, which avoid a root search for the classical
dynamics, but at the cost of performing numerically integrals whose evaluation
requires a sampling on the quantum scale, and which are therefore not well
designed to address the deep semiclassical regime. Along the way, we get a deeper
understanding of the origin of these interference effects and an intuitive
geometric picture associated with them.

BACKGROUND: Integrative mental health care can be applied to treat depression
with a person-centered, lifestyle-modifying, and more salutogenic approach to
mental health and human flourishing. In this article, we report on the
feasibility and acceptability of a new mind-body program, Meditation Based
Lifestyle Modification (MBLM), in outpatients with mild or moderate depression.
METHODS: This is a single-arm mixed-methods feasibility study of n = 25
outpatients in psychiatric care. Depressive symptoms, scores for mindfulness,
aspects of spirituality, and eudaemonic well-being based on yoga philosophy were 
assessed at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Adherence was monitored 
and face-to-face interviews were held after the program to explore the
acceptability and feasibility of MBLM.
RESULTS: Twenty patients (75 %) completed at least six sessions of the course.
Adherence was 87.5 % of allocated sessions. In qualitative analysis, more than
half of the participants experienced novelty and inspiration through practicing
the ethical aspects of yoga (e.g., nonviolence, truthfulness, etc.). Almost all
participants experienced a decrease in emotional distress. Virtually all
participants reported more self-confidence and self-acceptance. In quantitative
analysis, participants reported a clinically important decrease in depressive
symptoms of 39.23 % (p = .002), eudaemonic well-being increased significantly in 
a range of related scales and scores for mindfulness increased (p < .001).
CONCLUSION: MBLM is a highly acceptable and feasible program for outpatients with
mild to moderate depression. This comprehensive, lifestyle-modifying approach is 
highly relevant to preventing and treating mental illness, and treating psychic
comorbidities in patients with chronic somatic illness.

AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of a 12-month multifactorial intervention by
primary care nurses using health assets in increasing adherence to physical
activity prescription (150 min/week) in patients with two or more cardiovascular 
risk factors.
BACKGROUND: Physical activity promotion is a priority and helps to decrease
mortality risk due to cardiovascular diseases. However, adherence to the habitual
physical activity prescription in primary healthcare settings is low.
DESIGN: Multicentre, single-blind, parallel randomized (in two different
branches) clinical trial.
METHODS: In total, 263 participants from 20 primary healthcare centres in
Mallorca completed the randomized controlled trial study (intervention group
N = 128, control group N = 135). The intervention consisted in four visits and
included a motivational interview and an individualized prescription of physical 
activity using health assets. Primary outcome measure was the number of
participants performing at least 150 min of weekly physical activity. Secondary
outcomes included physical activity level and physical fitness, Sense of
Coherence, cardiovascular risk, sociodemographic data, trans-theoretical stage of
change, sleep quality, and depression.
RESULTS: Adherence to the recommendation of at least 150 min of physical activity
was higher in the intervention than in the control group (χ2  = 3.951, p = .047).
However, this higher adherence did not suppose higher physical activity levels
because no differences between groups were found in the total physical activity
performed after intervention (t=-0.915, p = .361). At the end of the intervention
participants randomized to the intervention group spent more time walking than
participants in the control group (t = 2.260, p = .025).
CONCLUSION: The multifactorial intervention performed by primary care nurses
induced a higher adherence to the 150-min of weekly physical activity
recommendation.
IMPACT: Adherence to the usual physical activity prescription in primary care is 
low. Physical activity prescription performed by primary care nurses and based on
health assets and motivational interview can help to increase physical activity
levels of patients. The main finding of the present study was that prescription
using this approach was shown to be effective, leading to a higher adherence in
the intervention group. This intervention is feasible in the nurse's primary
healthcare setting, thus it could be implemented as the main tool when exercise
is prescribed.

Background: Retinal astrocytic hamartoma (RAH) is a tumor that can be sporadic or
in the context of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and has been reported to be
associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in a few cases.Patient and
methods: A 65-year-old male patient with NF1 was referred for ophthalmological
evaluation. Comprehensive examination, near-infrared reflectance (NIR),
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT), fluorescein angiography
(FFA), and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) were carried out. The follow-up
of the patient was at 4 and 7 years.Results: Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 
was 20/20 in both eyes. Anterior segment examination revealed bilateral Lisch
nodules. Fundus examination was unremarkable but at NIR and SDOCT the patient
presented choroidal hamartoma, microvascular retinal alterations, and enlarged
choroidal vessels in both eyes. NIR also revealed an unusual area of
peripapillary hyporeflectivity in the right eye. On SDOCT, this corresponded to
an elevated peripapillary mass characterized by intralesional optically empty
cavities in the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell layer-inner
plexiform layer (GCL-IPL), diagnosed as a RAH. Four years later, BCVA was 20/25
with a retinal schisis departing from the lesion to the macula. At 7 years, BCVA 
was stable at 20/25, the lesion was smaller, and there was a slight reduction of 
the schisis.Conclusion: RAH is a rare finding in NF1 and the translucent type has
not been previously reported. RAH in NF1 has a peripapillary location and
demonstrates clinically unpredictable behavior; thus, close monitoring with
multimodal imaging is advisable.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought about several
features that increased the sense of fear and confusion, such as quarantine and
financial losses among other stressors, which may have led to adverse
psychosocial outcomes. The influence of such stressors took place within a
broader sociocultural context that needs to be considered. The objective was to
examine how the psychological response to the pandemic varied across countries
and identify which risk/protective factors contributed to this response. An
online survey was conducted from 29 May 2020-12 June 2020, among a multinational 
sample of 8806 adults from eight countries/regions (Canada, United States,
England, Switzerland, Belgium, Hong Kong, Philippines, New Zealand). Probable
generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depression episode (MDE) were
assessed. The independent role of a wide range of potential factors was examined 
using multilevel logistic regression. Probable GAD and MDE were indicated by
21.0% and 25.5% of the respondents, respectively, with an important variation
according to countries/regions (GAD: 12.2-31.0%; MDE: 16.7-32.9%). When
considered together, 30.2% of the participants indicated probable GAD or MDE.
Several factors were positively associated with a probable GAD or MDE, including 
(in descending order of importance) weak sense of coherence (SOC), lower age,
false beliefs, isolation, threat perceived for oneself/family, mistrust in
authorities, stigma, threat perceived for country/world, financial losses, being 
a female, and having a high level of information about COVID-19. Having a weak
SOC yielded the highest adjusted odds ratio for probable GAD or MDE (3.21; 95%
confidence interval (CI): 2.73-3.77). This pandemic is having an impact on
psychological health. In some places and under certain circumstances, however,
people seem to be better protected psychologically. This is a unique opportunity 
to evaluate the psychosocial impacts across various sociocultural backgrounds,
providing important lessons that could inform all phases of disaster risk
management.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Applying strategies that improve sense of coherence (SOC)
may positively affect adolescents' wellbeing. This may be particularly beneficial
for those with chronic conditions. Therefore, having a valid measurement tool for
SOC is important. This study assessed the validity and reliability of the Arabic 
version of the SOC questionnaire (A-SOC). Secondary objectives were to establish 
baseline data on SOC levels in a population of adolescents in the United Arab
Emirates.
METHODS: We used a cross-sectional correlational design.
RESULTS: The A-SOC was found to be a valid tool, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.75.
The mean A-SOC score in the study sample was 57.38.
CONCLUSIONS: Following an initial assessment of children's SOC, healthcare
professionals could implement strategies that improve SOC for this population,
thereby improving their general wellbeing.

PURPOSE: A case of bilateral choroidal metastasis from an adenoid cystic
carcinoma of the submandibular gland is described.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-years-old woman with a history of metastatic adenoid
cystic carcinoma presented with visual impairment in both eyes. Fundus images
showed bilateral creamy-white choroidal masses. Optical coherence tomography
revealed subretinal fluid with high reflective speckles and a "lumpy bumpy"
anterior contour of the lesions. Fluorescein angiography showed a hypofluorescent
pattern of the lesions in early arterial phases, and progressive late
hyperfluorescence. A diagnosis of bilateral choroidal metastasis from adenoid
cystic carcinoma was made. The patient was advised to underwent palliative
chemotherapy, but she expired a few weeks after the diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Salivary gland carcinoma rarely metastasizes to the choroid, with few
cases described in literature. In patients with a history of salivary glands
tumor the possibility of choroidal metastatization should always be considered.

Fostering the Reconstruction of Meaning Among the General Population During the
COVID-19 Pandemic.

The COVID-19 outbreak has seen people in many countries asked to radically modify
their way of life in compliance with sweeping safety measures. During the current
crisis, technology is turning out to be key, in that it allows practitioners to
deliver psychological services to people who would otherwise be unreachable.
However, professionals cannot solely rely on their traditional modes of practice,
in that different methods are required to bring to light the needs of those
affected by the emergency. People are being overwhelmed by a cascade of unusual
and unexpected events that are putting a strain on their everyday routines and
usual meaning-making systems; ongoing challenges to their employment and
financial status will likely divert personal resources away from psychological
well-being. We therefore argue that psychologists should also consider the needs 
of the general population. Among those who may require help-aside from the main
targets of psychological intervention, such as healthcare personnel and COVID-19 
patients and their relatives-specific attention should be paid to those who are
not at the center of the crisis. We suggest that this large segment of potential 
users may benefit from a non-medical approach focused on the promotion of
meaning-making processes. Indeed, the disruptive nature of the current situation 
hinders sense-making and threatens to undermine psychological balance and
well-being, at an individual as well as at a societal level. The present article 
proposes a methodological perspective based on the reconstruction of
meaning-making processes (sense of coherence, predictability, metaphors,
narratives). Specifically, psychological interventions should promote personal
and collective resources with a view to: "normalizing" current distressful
experiences (i.e., acknowledging that such reactions are normal in light of the
present situation); widening the observational field, taking relational contexts 
into account, and promoting an understanding of distressful experiences as coping
strategies; fostering meaning-making/reconstruction processes through the use of 
appropriate metaphors and narratives; promoting a sense of coherence. We present 
two clinical vignettes to illustrate how these principles might be applied in
practice. In conclusion, the exceptional psychological challenges posed by the
COVID-19 pandemic require practitioners to adopt a broad and flexible perspective
on clinical intervention.

The mediating role of sense of coherence on mental health outcomes in carers of
older dependent relatives: A longitudinal study.

BACKGROUND: Sense of coherence (SOC) is an important protective factor for carer 
well-being but research to date remains cross-sectional, focusing primarily on
the direct effects of SOC on carers' mental health. The study's aim was to
investigate the mediating role of SOC in the longitudinal relationship between
caregiver strain and carers' psychological health, and its stability over time.
METHODS: Prospective longitudinal study conducted in Jaén (Spain) with a
probabilistic sample of 132 carers of older people, with data collected at
baseline and at 1-year follow-up. We measured SOC, caregiver strain, anxiety and 
depressive symptoms, and several care-recipient characteristics and intensity of 
care provided. We used multiple linear regression modelling and the Sobel test to
analyse mediation effects.
RESULTS: SOC was significantly negatively longitudinally associated with both
anxiety (β = -0.38, p = 0.001) and depressive symptoms (β = -0.28, p = 0.023),
after controlling for several confounders. SOC mediated both the relationship
between caregiver strain and anxiety, and caregiver strain and depressive
symptoms (Sobel test: p < 0.001 for anxiety and p < 0.001 for depressive
symptoms). Differences between baseline and 1-year follow-up SOC scores were not 
statistically significant (p = 0.617).
CONCLUSIONS: SOC appears to buffer the impact of caregiver strain on symptoms of 
depression and anxiety in informal carers of older people. Our data showed that
SOC is an important psychological resource for carers that remained relatively
stable under non-experimental conditions over a period of 1 year in this sample. 
The findings suggest that interventions aimed at strengthening SOC may protect
carer psychological well-being.

Development of a Nostalgic Remembering Intervention: Feeling Safe in Dyads
Receiving Palliative Care for Advanced Heart Failure.

Fleury J, Komnenich P, Coon DW, Volk-Craft B.

BACKGROUND: Dyads receiving palliative care for advanced heart failure are at
risk for the loss of feeling safe, experienced as a fractured sense of coherence,
discontinuity in sense of self and relationships, and strained social connections
and altered roles. However, few theory-based interventions have addressed feeling
safe in this vulnerable population.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to describe the development of the
Nostalgic Remembering Intervention to strengthen feeling safe and promote
adaptive physiological and psychological regulation in dyads receiving palliative
care for heart failure.
CONCLUSIONS: Systematic intervention development is essential to understand what,
for whom, why, and how an intervention works in producing outcomes. Program
theory provided a systematic approach to the development of the Nostalgic
Remembering Intervention, including conceptualization of the problem targeted by 
the intervention, specification of critical inputs and conditions that
operationalize the intervention, and understanding the mediating processes
leading to expected outcomes.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Creating a foundation for cardiovascular nursing research 
and practice requires continued, systematic development of theory-based
interventions to best meet the needs of dyads receiving palliative care for heart
failure. The development of the Nostalgic Remembering Intervention to strengthen 
feeling safe in dyads provides a novel and relevant approach.

From Shattered Goals to Meaning in Life: Life Crafting in Times of the COVID-19
Pandemic.

The novel COVID-19 pandemic has created an extraordinary situation for our
generation, with many countries being on lockdown. With this, new situation comes
many psychological challenges not only for health care workers and people
suffering from COVID-19 but also for the general population. Adapting to the new 
situation can be demanding. Experts have suggested that emotions during this
situation are very similar to grief, and people experience emptiness and sadness 
about the loss of their normal lives, which can even lead to a loss of meaning in
life. In this paper, we argue that life crafting could offer a way to help people
cope with the situation and renew their sense of meaning. A life crafting
intervention is based on theoretical insights from multiple areas of research,
like positive psychology, expressive writing, and the salutogenesis framework.
Life-crafting interventions help people find meaning in life by focusing on their
ideal future, and helping them set goals, and make concrete plans to achieve
those goals and overcome obstacles. Since having a clear purpose or meaning in
life has been shown to have many benefits, we propose that it can also help
people to cope with the psychological effects of the pandemic. A life-crafting
intervention can offer people a chance to evaluate their goals in a time of
uncertainty and rediscover meaning in life to guide them through these difficult 
times.

The confinement forced by COVID-19 can have repercussions on the health of people
diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The objective of this study is to analyze the 
relationships between physical activity, a sense of coherence, resilience and
coping among people diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis during the health emergency
situation. To achieve this goal, this transversal descriptive study included 84
patients that belonged to multiple sclerosis associations during the period of
confinement. Participants filled out the Physical Activity (IPAQ-SF), Sense of
Coherence (SOC-13), Resilience Scale (ER-14) and coping (COPE-28) questionnaires.
The results showed that the average age was 46.9 and that 67.9% had Relapsing
Remittent Multiple Sclerosis diagnosed on average 13.9 years ago. They had a high
degree (33.3%) and moderate degree (34.5%) of physical activity, high levels of
resilience, while the level of a sense of coherence was average and the most
commonly used strategies for coping were active confrontation and religion.
Physical activity was not related to the rest of the studied variables, but there
were correlations between the other variables. The people with multiple sclerosis
who belong to patient associations have remained physically active during the
obligatory confinement period and have elevated degrees of resilience and an
average sense of coherence, as well as using suitable coping strategies, which is
why the social-health resource of belonging to a patient association could be
boosting these variables that are beneficial to their health.

Exposure to biodiverse environments such as forests can benefit human well-being,
and evidence suggests exposure to high microbial diversity may improve mental and
immune health. However, the factors that drive microbial community assembly are
poorly understood, as is the relationship between exposure to these communities
and human health. We characterized airborne bacterial communities in two
disparate types of urban greenspace (forest and grass) in late-spring 2017 at
sites previously sampled in late-summer 2015 in Eugene-Springfield, Oregon, using
high-throughput metabarcode sequencing. While all sites shared a core aerobiome
in late-spring consisting of plant- and soil-associated genera, forests had
significantly higher diversity than grass sites (F = 12, P = 0.004). Vegetation
type explained 14% of the difference between forest and grass aerobiomes, yet
individual site location explained 41% of the variation. These results were
similar to but amplified over those from late summer, suggesting that both
aerobiome diversity and vegetation-driven effects are higher when deciduous
foliage is fresher and more active, temperatures cooler, and humidity higher.
Continued exploration and hypothesis-driven research will enable development of
mechanistic theory describing key drivers of urban aerobiome assembly and its
relationship to human health, which, in turn, will help urban designers and
planners create evidence-based salutogenic cities for future generations.

PURPOSE: To explore the experiences of adolescents with a sibling suffering from 
cancer from a salutogenic health promotion perspective.
METHODS: Seven female siblings aged 13-17 years were interviewed. The interviews 
were transcribed and subjected to qualitative content analysis.
RESULTS: The analysis findings adhered largely to one main theme: new challenges 
and needs in everyday life, consisting of the two domains cancer into life and
helpful resources to cope. Categories related to the cancer into life domain were
new routines and concerns, fear, loneliness, and growing up. Helpful resources to
cope were categorized as support from others, understanding, faith and hope, and 
normal activities.
CONCLUSION: Prominent in the siblings' descriptions were the challenging changes 
in everyday life including difficult feelings such as loneliness, and a need for 
understanding. Social support appeared as a crucial salutogenic coping resource
to achieve understanding, faith and hope, and identity-crucial spheres to achieve
meaning in life. This study has demonstrated the significance of salutogenesis in
a new setting, and the findings could be of relevance to teachers and health
professionals consulting with the siblings of children with cancer. Further
research should be conducted to pinpoint concrete health-promoting measures that 
might benefit this group.

Promoting Students' Sense of Coherence in Medical Education Using Transformative 
Learning Activities.

Objective: Transformative learning theory offers medical educators a particularly
relevant insight into student learning. Transformative learning involves
critically reflecting on assumptions and actions using empirical research methods
and participating in a continuing discourse to validate the best reflective
judgement and act according to new insights. The purpose of this paper is to
investigate medical students' experiences with transformative learning activities
and empirically and theoretically explain how these activities contribute to
their understanding of the interplay between theoretical knowledge and
professional practice, thereby creating a sense of coherence in medical
education.
Methods: This paper analyzes the data from interviews with 40 medical students
derived from a qualitative longitudinal research project in Norway from 2012
through 2018.
Results: Students characterize linking theoretical knowledge with professional
practice, experiencing authentic placement situations with real patients, and
discussing and critically reflecting on cases and professional practice with
experienced doctors as learning activities that transformed their understanding
of professional practice. These transformative learning activities influenced
students' perceptions of educational content and demands as being comprehensible,
manageable, and meaningful, which are the core components of "sensing coherence" 
in professional education. Moreover, experiencing a lack of knowledge in either
case-based learning on campus or when meeting patients in clinical placements
motivates students to pursue further theoretical studies.
Conclusion: Medical education includes rich opportunities to use transformative
learning activities both on campus and at clinical placement sites, but it is not
given that these types of learning activities are present in the teaching offered
at all the various learning sites; thus, enhanced awareness of why and how to
promote transformative learning is required among medical educators.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the acceptability of different bisphosphonate regimens for 
the treatment of osteoporosis among patients, clinicians and managers, payers and
academics.
DESIGN: A systematic review of primary qualitative studies. Seven databases were 
searched from inception to July 2019. Screening, data extraction and quality
assessment of full-articles selected for inclusion were performed independently
by two authors. A framework synthesis was applied to extracted data based on the 
theoretical framework of acceptability (TFA). The TFA includes seven domains
relating to sense-making, emotions, opportunity costs, burden, perceived
effectiveness, ethicality and self-efficacy. Confidence in synthesis findings was
assessed.
SETTING: Any developed country healthcare setting.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients, healthcare professionals, managers, payers and academics.
INTERVENTION: Experiences and views of oral and intravenous bisphosphonates.
RESULTS: Twenty-five studies were included, mostly describing perceptions of oral
bisphosphonates. We identified, with high confidence, how patients and healthcare
professionals make sense (coherence) of bisphosphonates by balancing perceptions 
of need against concerns, how uncertainty prevails about bisphosphonate perceived
effectiveness and a number of individual and service factors that have potential 
to increase self-efficacy in recommending and adhering to bisphosphonates. We
identified, with moderate confidence, that bisphosphonate taking induces concern,
but has the potential to engender reassurance, and that both side effects and
special instructions for taking oral bisphosphonates can result in treatment
burden. Finally, we identified with low confidence that multimorbidity plays a
role in people's perception of bisphosphonate acceptability.
CONCLUSION: By using the lens of acceptability, our findings demonstrate with
high confidence that a theoretically informed, whole-system approach is necessary
to both understand and improve adherence. Clinicians and patients need supporting
to understand the need for bisphosphonates, and clinicians need to clarify to
patients what constitutes bisphosphonate treatment success. Further research is
needed to explore perspectives of male patients and those with multimorbidity
receiving bisphosphonates, and patients receiving intravenous treatment.

PURPOSE: We describe the characteristics of an isolated retinal cavernous
hemangioma in a young female patient using multimodal imaging.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Fundus examination of the right eye showed a large vascular
mass, composed by clusters of dark red and dilated saccular angiomatous
formations with superficial whitish fibroglial tissue and hemorrhages, located in
the inferonasal peripheral retina, along the vascular arcade. On green-light
fundus autofluorescence the lesion appeared hypoautofluorescent, with moderately 
hyperautofluorescent areas. On multiColor imaging it showed mainly a green
pseudocolor, with knobby surface and well-defined irregular margins. Fundus
fluorescein angiography showed early hypofluorescence within the tumor mass and
late incomplete staining, without leakage. Ocular ultrasonography documented an
elevated well-defined hyperechogenic lesion, with high internal reflectivity,
without choroidal excavation, retinal detachment, or acoustic shadowing. Swept
source optical coherence tomography showed multilobulated cavernous formations,
varying in size, containing for the greatest part hyperreflective material,
within an interconnecting fibrous scaffold and with an overlying partially
adherent epiretinal membrane. Optical coherence tomography angiography documented
a few highly reflective, tortuous and abnormal branching veins extending into the
tumor mass, with a root-like appearance, and surrounding nodular changes,
corresponding to the angiomatous formations.
CONCLUSIONS: Different imaging modalities can be used in combination for a better
evaluation of the pathological features of this rare vascular tumor.

Purpose: Different patterns of diabetic macular edema (DME) suggest different
pathogenesis and drug response. We evaluated the outcomes after intravitreal
dexamethasone (DEX) implant for DME with or without serous retinal detachment
(SRD).
Methods: In this retrospective study, 22 naïve patients (23 eyes) with DME who
underwent a single DEX implant were evaluated. Based on the optical coherence
tomographic pattern of DME, 12 eyes had a cystoid macular edema pattern (Group 1)
and 11 eyes had an SRD pattern (Group 2). The best-corrected visual acuity
(BCVA), central retinal thickness (СRТ), central retinal volume (CRV), SRD height
(SRDh), and intraocular pressure (IOP) were recorded before and at two and four
months after the treatment.
Results: There were no significant differences between the groups regarding
demographic, clinical data and outcomes at baseline. In Group 1, the CRT and CRV 
significantly decreased at two months (P = 0.002 and P = 0.01, respectively),
while the BCVA significantly improved at four months (P = 0.03). In Group 2, the 
CRT and CRV significantly improved (P < 0.01 and P ≤ 0.01, respectively) during
the follow-up period. At four months, both groups showed a recurrence of DME,
Group 1 in particular (two-month CRT reduction, -149 ± 127 µm vs four-month CRT
reduction, -72 ± 174 µm; P = 0.04). The mean reduction in CRV was significantly
different at four months (Group 1, -0.49 ± 1.7 mm 3 vs Group 2, -1.3 ± 1.3 mm 3 ;
P = 0.04). In Group 2, the SRDh significantly decreased at two (P = 0.01) and
four months (P = 0.01). Four cases with elevated IOP were managed.
Conclusion: DEX implants were found to be effective in different patterns of DME.
The SRD pattern may predict a longer-lasting morphologic efficacy.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate fear of childbirth (FOC) and sense of
coherence (SOC), and their components in women expecting their first child.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study where 414 women answered the Wijma Delivery
Expectancy Questionnaire Version A and the Sense of Coherence Scale. Statistical 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: The main results show that women with severe FOC reported lower SOC, and
all three components of SOC were lower in women with severe FOC.
Comprehensibility turned out to have a significant correlation with FOC.
Psychological problems before pregnancy were more common in women with severe FOC
and low SOC.
CONCLUSIONS: Women with severe FOC reported lower SOC and lower levels of each of
the following components: comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness.

Toward a Unified Language (and Application) of Salutogenic Design: An Opinion
Paper.

Mazzi A(1).

Author information: 
(1)GBBN Architects, Cincinnati, OH, USA.

This opinion paper posits that there is a misalignment of how the theory of
salutogenesis is defined by scholars and the way that salutogenesis is reflected 
in architectural practice. Many practitioners use this term to describe their
work without a clear understanding of the social theory behind it. A background
on the original theory, brief review of its subsequent development, and the
importance of stress in determining health are explored. Antonovsky, originator
of the salutogenesis theory, believed that health was represented by a spectrum
ranging from disease to wellness and that stress and an individual's ability to
respond to it determined where they would be on that spectrum. His work indicates
that one's resources determined the impact of a stressor. The elements Antonovsky
termed environmental generalized resistance resources (GRR) are considered
because they are within the purview of design practitioners to influence. While
Antonovsky's work became focused on an aspect of salutogenesis he termed sense of
coherence (SOC), he encouraged exploration of additional aspects. This article
proposes an expanded definition of salutogenesis that includes five aspects of
environmental GRR that can address or alleviate specific causes of stress-SOC,
biophilia, relaxation response, self-empowerment, and prospect and refuge. A more
specific language and a common, consistent way of understanding what makes an
environment salutogenic emerges with examples of each described. A common
language will bring consistency to design practice and make complex social
theories more accessible for practitioners, leading to them being more rigorously
and universally applied in design.

In this study we examined whether aspects of positive functioning [reappraisal,
sense of coherence (SOC), and positivity] were associated with spiritual
well-being and psychological distress after controlling for negative functioning 
(skin-related symptoms, type of disease, and expressive suppression) in
individuals with skin diseases. We also examined whether negative functioning
aspects were linked to spiritual well-being and distress when controlling for
aspects of positive functioning. The study used a cross-sectional design with a
sample of 192 individuals with psoriasis and systemic sclerosis (SSc) (M age =
51.6 years, SD = 16.5). Two hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted to
determine whether spiritual well-being and psychological distress were accounted 
for by skin-related symptoms, type of disease, emotion regulation strategies,
SOC, and positivity. Positivity was the most important contributor to better
spiritual well-being, followed by both the comprehensibility/manageability and
meaningfulness SOC subscales, after controlling for the other variables. High
skin-related symptoms and expressive suppression were associated with lower
psychological distress, whereas high SOC and reappraisal correlated with higher
psychological distress. The findings of this study pave the way for further
research on how SOC and positivity may reduce the effects of both skin-related
symptoms and emotion dysregulation and facilitate spiritual well-being of
individuals with skin diseases. Interventions aimed to enhance inner resources of
these individuals and help them to find a meaning in their experience of skin
disease might reduce psychological distress and improve spiritual well-being. Our
findings suggest that healthcare professionals should consider positive
functioning aspects in future interventions for individuals with skin diseases.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is 10-20 years lower among people with a severe
mental health disorder. Most of these early deaths are due to chronic conditions,
including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Smoking is a major risk factor
for these conditions and introducing smokefree policies has been recommended to
mental health service providers in England by the National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence (NICE), in their Public Health Guideline 48: Smoking: acute, 
maternity and mental health services. This paper reports a process evaluation of 
introducing these policy recommendations, which were updated in 2013.
METHOD: Process data were collected through semi-structured interviews with staff
(n = 51), members of partnering organisations (n = 5), service users (n = 7) and 
carers (n = 2) between November 2016 - April 2017. Normalization Process Theory
(NPT) was used to design the data collection tools and analyse the data. A
framework approach was taken with the analysis, using the four concepts of NPT:
coherence, cognitive participation, collective action and reflexive monitoring.
RESULTS: The policy made sense to some staff, patients and carers (coherence) who
'bought-into' the idea (cognitive participation) but other participants
disagreed. Although smokefree policies were operationalised (collective action), 
sometimes they were opposed. Progress was made, especially in some units, but
continued to be resisted in others. Informal appraisal of progress (reflexive
monitoring) presented a varied picture.
CONCLUSION: Some progress has been made in terms of changing an entrenched,
smoking culture into one that is smokefree on Trust sites across the region.
Perseverance and resourcing over the long-term is required to establish a
non-smoking culture in on-site provision of mental health services.

Corticokinematic coherence (CKC) is the phase coupling between limb kinematics
and cortical neurophysiological signals, reflecting cortical processing of
proprioceptive afference, and it is reproducible when estimated with
magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, feasibility and reproducibility of CKC
based on electroencephalography (EEG) is still unclear and is the primary object 
of the present report. Thirteen healthy right-handed volunteers (seven females,
21.7 ± 4.3 yr) participated in two combined MEG/EEG sessions 12.6 ± 1.3 mo apart.
Participants' dominant and nondominant index finger was continuously moved at 3
Hz for 4 min separately using a pneumatic-movement actuator. Coherence was
computed between finger acceleration and three derivations of EEG signals: 1)
average reference, 2) bipolar derivations, and 3) surface Laplacian. CKC strength
was defined as the peak coherence value at movement frequency.
Intraclass-correlation coefficient values (0.74-0.93) indicated excellent
intersession reproducibility for CKC strength for all derivations and moved
fingers. CKC strength obtained with EEG was approximately two times lower
compared with MEG, but the values were positively correlated across the
participants. CKC strength was significantly (P < 0.01) higher for bipolar
(session 1: 0.19 ± 0.09; session 2: 0.20 ± 0.10) and surface Laplacian (session
1: 0.22 ± 0.09; session 2: 0.21 ± 0.09) derivations than for the average
reference (session 1: 0.10 ± 0.04; session 2: 0.11 ± 0.05). We demonstrated that 
CKC is a feasible and reproducible tool to monitor proprioception using EEG
recordings, although the strength of CKC was twice lower for EEG compared with
MEG. Laplacian and bipolar (CP3-C1/CP3-C3 and CP4-C2/C4-FC2) EEG derivation(s)
are recommended for future research and clinical use of CKC method. NEW &
NOTEWORTHY The most important message in this report is that the corticokinematic
coherence (CKC) method is a feasible and reproducible tool to quantify, map, and 
follow cortical proprioceptive ("the movement sense") processing using EEG that
is more widely available for CKC recordings than previously used
magnetoencephalography designs, in basic research, but especially in clinical
environments. We provide useful recommendations for optimal EEG derivations for
cost-effective experimental designs, making it possible to scale up in sample
size in future studies.

Background: In addition to an adjusting physical appearance, children with cleft 
lip and palate also deal with psychological and psychosocial limitation. Mothers'
sense of coherence (SOC) could be a psychosocial determinant of oral health
quality of life (OH-QoL) of cleft lip and palate patients. Hence, the present
study was done to assess the relationship of mothers' SOC on OH-QoL in cleft lip 
and palate patients.
Materials and Methods: The present cross-sectional questionnaire study was
conducted on mothers of cleft lip and palate children. The first part consisted
of demographic details. The second part of scale was the early childhood and oral
health impact scale (ECOHIS) which had a total 13 questions with responses on a
4-point Likert scale. The third part was to assess mothers' SOC using a short
version of SOC-13 consists of 13 items on a 7-point Likert scale. Chi-square test
was applied to assess the association between mothers' SOC, sociodemographic
characteristic, and children's OHRQoL. In the analysis, P < 0.05 was considered
significant.
Results: Out of 69% of low SOC population, 21.73% were rural, 20.39% were from
peri-urban, and 57.97% population was from urban areas. Out of 150 participants, 
2.40% in high ECOHIS were illiterate/primary school, "31.32% were high
school/intermediate/diploma had high ECOHIS while 66.26% were high
school/intermediate/diploma" had low ECOHIS, and 25.37% were
graduate/postgraduate. Mothers' education and locality were statistically
significant P < 0.001.
Conclusion: Action to enhance mothers' SOC might form part of oral health
promotion and help to improve the oral health quality of life of cleft lip and
palate patients.

PURPOSE: This study was aimed at exploring the type and role of relationships
between sexual function, sense of coherence (SOC), and well-being in a sample of 
Iranian breast cancer survivors.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study with correlational design, data were
collected from 181 survivors by consecutive sampling. They answered demographic
and clinical information sheet, the SOC scale, the Female Sexual Function Index
(FSFI), and the Health Index (HI). The data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.
RESULTS: The mean age of survivors was 47.04 ± 9.05 years. Most survivors were
menopausal (51.9%) and underwent mastectomy (69.1%), and 12 months or more had
passed since their treatment ended (71.2%). Sexual function was positively
correlated with the level of SOC (r = 0.20) and the HI (r = 0.33). Also, there
was a positive correlation between the level of SOC and the HI (r = 0.51). The
results of logistic regression analyses showed the protective role of the SOC
(OR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92-0.97) and the HI (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.79-0.96) for
women's sexual function. According to these results, the mediating role of the
SOC was assessed between the variables of the HI and the FSFI. The SOC revealed a
complete mediating effect in this relationship.
CONCLUSIONS: The mediator role of the SOC between survivors' well-being and their
sexual function helps nurses and clinicians to understand how the SOC can be used
as a screening test to detect survivors who are at risk of sexual problems and to
plan for salutogenic interventions.

BACKGROUND: Care activities provided by community health practitioners for older 
adults primarily focused on disease prevention and management. However, healthy
longevity can go beyond disease prevention and management and promote greater
well-being by tapping into the accrual of resources that older adults possess
using the salutogenic approach. This study explored how health resources are used
among older adults who are residing in senior-only households to promote and
maintain health, with the intent of providing insights into how community health 
practitioners can support these older adults via asset-based strategies.
METHODS: We adopted a descriptive qualitative study design using focus group
discussions. Twenty-seven older adults who either lived alone or with their
spouses were purposively sampled from an elderly populated residential estate in 
Singapore. Six focus group discussions, conducted from December 2016 to May 2017,
were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: The themes that emerged were 'tapping on internal self-care repository',
'maintaining and preserving informal social support', and 'enabling self by using
environmental aids', and an eco-map of aging assets was used to capture an
overview of internal and external resources. With the repository of personal
strengths, knowledge, and experiences, these older adults were generally
resourceful in navigating around their resource-rich environments to cope with
everyday life stressors and promote health. However, they were occasionally
limited by individual factors that affected their comprehension, access,
maintenance, and utilization of resources.
CONCLUSION: The eco-map of aging assets can be used as an assessment framework by
community health practitioners to recognize, consider, and build a repertoire of 
resources among these older adults. It serves as a gentle reminder to adopt an
ecological approach in considering and tapping into older adults' wide-ranging
personal, social, and environmental resources. Community health practitioners can
support resource integration as resource facilitators via cognitive, behavioral, 
and motivational salutogenic pathways to overcome resource mobilization barriers 
faced by older adults. Such an approach helps older adults to find their internal
capabilities and abilities to know who, where, what, and how to seek external
resources to identify solutions, creating the intrinsic value to sustain their
actions on resource utility.

Author information: 
(1)School of Physical and Occupational Therapy, Faculty of Medicine, McGill
University, Montreal, Canada.

BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation practice is increasingly tied to global trends. First,
healthcare services are increasingly tailored to be patient-centered, requiring
knowledge of sociocultural contexts and experiences of a diverse patient
population. Second, non-communicable diseases and morbidity stemming from
infectious diseases are creating greater needs for rehabilitation services in
countries facing this double burden of disease. Third, globalization continues to
shape the risk factors for disease and disability and influences the type of
services accessible and the financing and management of such services. Given this
context, there is a critical need to examine how global health (GH) is approached
in rehabilitation curricula. How students learn about these various dynamics will
impact their ability to practice in this environment and best meet the needs of
the patients and populations they are caring for.
OBJECTIVES: This study explores how university-level Canadian occupational and
physical therapy educators understand GH within their academic and clinical
practices.
METHODS: The project followed a qualitative design. Semi-structured interviews
were conducted with participants (n = 12; randomized purposive sampling was
used). A deductive and inductive thematic analysis was performed to describe the 
participants perspectives on and practices of GH education in rehabilitation
education programs.
FINDINGS: There was an overall coherence between the literature and the
participant's views of the constituent elements of GH. Participants viewed GH as 
a framework to broaden the clinical training of students by encouraging a
critical "clinical toolbox" via themes of structural competency, cultural
sensitivity, and a sense of global citizenship and stewardship. However, GH was
also described by participants as being implicitly present in the curriculum due 
to ambiguities regarding the scope of GH, seen as a key obstacle in the
integration of GH education in rehabilitation programs.
INTERPRETATION: Despite the growing interest and relevance of GH, there is a
noteworthy absence of GH education guidelines. There is a need to uncover the
scope and underpinnings of GH and to outline rehabilitation-oriented GH
competencies as per the positive value of GH attributed by the educators to the
training of our healthcare workforce.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONGlobal health
is seen by a sample of educators to provide rehabilitation students with a
critical and holistic "clinical toolkit" by introducing themes of structural
competency, cultural sensitivity and awareness, and global stewardship, enabling 
them to become good global clinicians and global citizens;The increased interest 
in global health throughout academic curricula presents new challenges for
educators and students, specifically relating to understanding the mission and
aims of this field. There is a need to clarify the notion and field of global
health and how it complements clinical training within rehabilitation
programs;There is a need to advance the literature on global health in
rehabilitation by exploring what competencies are seen to be relevant to the
field and practice of rehabilitation.

BACKGROUND: Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) and retinal vessel changes have both 
been associated to neurodegeneration/dementia, suggesting a possible link between
these two conditions in older age. We aimed to determine whether superficial and 
deep vascular density (SVD and DVD) of the capillary plexi of macular vasculature
can be associated with peripheral ARHL and age-related central auditory central
processing (CAPD).
METHODS: We analyzed data on 886 older participants (65 years+, age range:65-92
years) in the cross-sectional population-based Salus in Apulia Study. Optical
coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) was used to measure SVD and DVD of the
capillary plexi of the macula at the 3-mm circle area centered on the fovea
(whole retina), the parafoveal quadrant, and foveal quadrant. Disabling
peripheral ARHL was defined as >40 dB HL of pure tone average on the frequencies 
from 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 KHz in the better ear, and age-related CAPD as <50% at the 
Synthetic Sentence Identification with Ipsilateral Competitive Message test in at
least one ear.
RESULTS: DVD at the whole retina and at the parafoveal quadrant were inversely
associated only with age-related CAPD [odds ratio (OR):0.93; 95% confidence
interval (CI): 0.88-0.96 and OR:0.94; 95 CI:0.90-0.99, respectively]. No further 
associations with peripheral ARHL were evident.
CONCLUSIONS: Retinal vasculature is associated with central auditory processing
pathology, possibly playing an important role in early detection and
intervention. The association of retinal vascular density with age-related CAPD
may bring us a further step forward in understanding the biological mechanisms
underlying the links between neurodegeneration/dementia and ARHL.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore how the presence of family and health
professionals influences long-term critically ill patients' inner strength and
willpower as an incitement to keep fighting for recovery.
BACKGROUND: This study reports long-term critically ill patients' experiences of 
family and health professionals as health-promoting resources in terms of
significance for their inner strength and willpower. Earlier research on this
topic is scarce.
DESIGN: A qualitative, hermeneutic-phenomenological approach, within the context 
of Antonovsky's salutogenic theory.
METHODS: Seventeen long-term critically ill patients were interviewed once, at
6-18 months after ICU discharge. The consolidated criteria for reporting
qualitative research (COREQ) were used (Supplementary File 1).
RESULTS: Four main themes identified how family and staff promoted and challenged
the patient's inner strength and willpower: (a) the importance of family and
friends; my family was surrounding me, (b) staff contributions, (c) challenges to
inner strength and willpower in relation to family and (d) loneliness and
indifferent care.
CONCLUSION: This study brings new knowledge from the long-term critically ill
patient's view about the impact of family, friends and nurses on the patient's
inner strength and willpower. All impact is experienced positively and
negatively.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Knowledge from the long-term critically ill
patient's view is vital in nurse-patient interactions to facilitate liberation of
inner strength and willpower.

PURPOSE: To test the association between the Sense of Coherence (SOC) and the
fear of public speaking in university students.
METHOD: Cross-sectional study was carried out with a sample of 1124 undergraduate
students of a Brazilian public university. An online questionnaire was used
divided into three blocks: the first evaluated the sociodemographic data and the 
somatic symptoms of the fear of public speaking; the second evaluated the SOC,
through the SOC-13 questionnaire; and the third was composed by the Scale for
Self-Assessment in Public Speaking (SSPS), with questions that point out
cognitive aspects of this activity. The students were divided into two groups
(high SOC and low SOC) through the Two-step Cluster analysis. Data were analyzed 
descriptively and by the Mann-Whitney test and bi and multivariate logistic
regression models, with significance set at 5%.
RESULTS: The students who reported not being afraid to speak in public were more 
likely to belong to the high SOC group (OR = 3.19, 95% CI = 2.30-4.42). Students 
from the high SOC group self-assessed more positively on the SSPS scale (p
<0.001).
CONCLUSION: College students over 30 years old, on the second half of graduation,
with breathing discomfort, who do not report fear of public speaking and who
perceive themselves more positively for public speaking, they have the highest
SOC. Thus, it is observed the importance of considering the SOC as an important
coping resource, given the great interference of emotional aspects in public
speech.

de cursos de graduação de uma universidade pública brasileira. Foi utilizado
questionário online dividido em três blocos: o primeiro avaliou os dados
sociodemográficos e os sintomas somáticos do medo de falar em público; o segundo 
avaliou o SOC, por meio do questionário SOC-13; e o terceiro foi composto pela
Escala para Autoavaliação ao Falar em Público (SSPS), que norteia aspectos
cognitivos dessa atividade. Os universitários foram divididos em dois grupos (SOC
alto e SOC baixo) por meio da análise de Cluster de dois passos. Os dados foram
analisados de forma descritiva e por meio do teste de Mann-Whitney e modelos de
regressão logística bi e multivariado, com significância de 5%.Os universitários 
que relataram não ter medo de falar em público apresentaram mais chance de
pertencer ao grupo SOC alto (OR=3,19, IC95%=2,30-4,42). Os universitários do
grupo SOC alto se autoavaliaram mais positivamente na escala SSPS
(p<0.001).Universitários com mais de 30 anos, na segunda metade da graduação, das
áreas da Saúde e Exatas, com sintoma de respiração ofegante, que não relatam medo
de falar em público e que se autopercebem mais positivamente para falar em
público, apresentam o SOC mais alto. Diante do estudo, observa-se a importância
de se considerar o SOC como um recurso de enfrentamento importante, tendo em
vista a grande interferência dos aspectos emocionais na fala em público.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of nurse-led consultations on reducing
post-traumatic stress symptoms and increasing sense of coherence in discharged
ICU patients with clinically relevant post-traumatic stress symptoms and to
identify variables associated with symptoms 12 months later.
DESIGN: A pragmatic nonblinded randomized controlled trial.
SETTINGS: Five surgical and medical ICUs at Oslo University Hospital.
PATIENTS: Adult patients treated in the ICU greater than or equal to 24 hours
were screened with Post-Traumatic Stress Scale 10 intensive part B after ICU
discharge. Those scoring greater than or equal to 25 were included in the study.
INTERVENTION: Patients randomized to intervention group were offered three
nurse-led consultations within 2 months, and patients in the control group
received standard care.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sense of Coherence Scale 13 and Post-Traumatic
Stress Scale 10 intensive part B were completed after inclusion, and reevaluated 
after 3, 6, and 12 months. Linear mixed model for repeated measures and linear
regression analyses were performed. Among 523 screened patients, 111 and 113 were
randomized to intervention group and control group, respectively. Mean
Post-Traumatic Stress Scale 10 intensive part B score was 37 (±10) before
randomization. No differences in post-traumatic stress symptoms or sense of
coherence were found between intervention group versus control group, with a mean
Post-Traumatic Stress Scale 10 intensive part B score 39 (95% CI, 37-41) versus
37 (95% CI, 35-39), 32 (95% CI, 28-35) versus 32 (95% CI, 29-35), 31 (95% CI,
28-34) versus 30 (95% CI, 27-33), and 31 (95% CI, 28-34) versus 29 (95% CI,
26-33) at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. There was a significantly 
reduced Post-Traumatic Stress Scale 10 intensive part B score for both groups
during the year (p = 0.001). Low sense of coherence, pain, and previous
psychiatric problems were associated with increased level of post-traumatic
stress symptoms at 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Nurse-led consultations did not reveal any significant effect on
post-traumatic stress symptoms or sense of coherence after ICU discharge in
patients with clinically relevant symptoms.

AIM: This paper aims to discuss social networking sites as potentially
salutogenic, culturally relevant extensions to maternity care provision for
adolescent mothers.
BACKGROUND: Studies report that online networking may enhance social capital, a
concept linked to enhanced well-being, particularly for marginalized individuals.
Improving outcomes for adolescent mothers is an ongoing global strategy; thus,
this paper has relevance for all professionals involved in their care.
DESIGN: This is a discussion paper.
DATA SOURCES: This paper draws on the authors' research and is supported by
literature and theory. Key terms and Boolean operators were used to identifiy
English-language papers published in January 1995 to January 2019 in nine
databases and Google Scholar databases.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Despite limited evidence specific to adolescent
mothers, contextual studies suggest that social networking sites may enhance
well-being. Nurses and midwives need to understand adolescent mothers' use of
online networks to aid development of innovative, health-enhancing care
strategies using adolescent-familiar modalities.
CONCLUSION: This paper highlights the need for further research regarding the
value of professional engagement in online networks to enhance an adolescent's
transition to motherhood.

Background: The interrelationship between the sense of coherence, work
environment, work engagement, and psychological distress have particular interest
in non-health workers who carried out essential activities during the COVID-19
pandemic.
Objective: To assess the effects of the COVID-19 on the physical and mental
health of non-health workers.
Design: Observational descriptive cross-sectional study.
Data sources: 1089 questionnaires have been analysed. Engagement (UWES-9), sense 
of coherence (SOC-13), mental health (Goldberg GHQ-12), demographic data,
perception of health and stress and work environment were assessed.
Results: At low levels of engagement, the percentage of distress is higher
(77.9%). Low levels of sense of coherence correspond to the highest percentages
of distress (86.3%). The 94.1% believe it necessary for professionals and
volunteers involved in COVID-19 to receive psychological support. Low
comprehensibility is mediated by the perception of stress; if the perception is
low, comprehensibility is modulated by the level of significance; if it is low,
it generates 95.9% of distress.
Conclusion: The interrelationship between the sense of coherence, work
environment, work engagement, and psychological distress have particular interest
in non-health workers who carried out essential activities during the COVID-19
pandemic. Almost all respondents believed that professionals and volunteers
involved in COVID-19 should receive psychological support. This may be an
indicator of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on workers' mental health.

When we feel connected or engaged during social behavior, are our brains in fact 
"in sync" in a formal, quantifiable sense? Most studies addressing this question 
use highly controlled tasks with homogenous subject pools. In an effort to take a
more naturalistic approach, we collaborated with art institutions to crowdsource 
neuroscience data: Over the course of 5 years, we collected electroencephalogram 
(EEG) data from thousands of museum and festival visitors who volunteered to
engage in a 10-min face-to-face interaction. Pairs of participants with various
levels of familiarity sat inside the Mutual Wave Machine-an artistic
neurofeedback installation that translates real-time correlations of each pair's 
EEG activity into light patterns. Because such inter-participant EEG correlations
are prone to noise contamination, in subsequent offline analyses we computed
inter-brain coupling using Imaginary Coherence and Projected Power Correlations, 
two synchrony metrics that are largely immune to instantaneous, noise-driven
correlations. When applying these methods to two subsets of recorded data with
the most consistent protocols, we found that pairs' trait empathy, social
closeness, engagement, and social behavior (joint action and eye contact)
consistently predicted the extent to which their brain activity became
synchronized, most prominently in low alpha (~7-10 Hz) and beta (~20-22 Hz)
oscillations. These findings support an account where shared engagement and joint
action drive coupled neural activity and behavior during dynamic, naturalistic
social interactions. To our knowledge, this work constitutes a first
demonstration that an interdisciplinary, real-world, crowdsourcing neuroscience
approach may provide a promising method to collect large, rich datasets
pertaining to real-life face-to-face interactions. Additionally, it is a
demonstration of how the general public can participate and engage in the
scientific process outside of the laboratory. Institutions such as museums,
galleries, or any other organization where the public actively engages out of
self-motivation, can help facilitate this type of citizen science research, and
support the collection of large datasets under scientifically controlled
experimental conditions. To further enhance the public interest for the
out-of-the-lab experimental approach, the data and results of this study are
disseminated through a website tailored to the general public
(wp.nyu.edu/mutualwavemachine).

BACKGROUND: Birth is often viewed as a pathological event, consequently, there
has been an increase in literature focusing on predictors, experience and
implications of traumatic childbirth and childbirth-related posttraumatic stress.
However, to fully understand childbirth experiences a salutogenic perspective is 
required. This enables an understanding of what facilitates a positive childbirth
experience besides what places women at risk of experiencing traumatic
childbirth.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the psychosocial factors that could contribute to or be
influenced by women's subjective accounts of childbirth.
METHOD: An in-depth literature search across four databases was undertaken.
Quality appraisal based on internal and external validity was conducted and a
combined numerical summary and categorical description were undertaken.
FINDINGS: Nineteen papers were included in the review and the variables grouped
into three categories. The variables relate to 'Measures of labour and birth
experience' (discussing the impact of events and perceptions during labour and
birth). The second category discusses how 'support and relationships' can
potentially shape the birth experience or be altered by it and finally,
'Psychological variables: influence and impact' is examined extensively.
DISCUSSION: The results of the review highlight significant contradictory
evidence of what influences birth experiences. The findings confirm the dearth of
available literature concerning positive birth experiences and most variables
identified were pathogenic. This review suggests that such factors for PTSD may
differ from those that influence birth experiences and should be examined
separately. An enhanced understanding of the range of experiences is required to 
support women's rights in achieving a positive birth.

Trauma survivors who suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms
may be particularly vulnerable when facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet trauma
exposure may also lead to salutogenic outcomes, known as posttraumatic growth
(PTG). Nevertheless, the implications of PTG attributed to prior trauma, for
trauma survivors' adjustment when facing additional stressors, are unclear.
Addressing this gap, 528 Israeli trauma survivors were assessed for PTG and PTSD 
symptoms attributed to prior trauma, as well as peritraumatic stress symptoms
related to the pandemic, as part of an online survey. Analyses revealed that
being younger, female, quarantined, negatively self-rating one's health status,
and suffering from PTSD symptoms were associated with elevated peritraumatic
stress symptoms. Furthermore, PTG attributed to prior trauma made a significant
contribution in explaining elevated intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal
symptoms. The present results point to the need for clinicians to take into
account reports of PTG attributed to prior trauma when treating trauma survivors 
during the current pandemic.

AIMS: Tai chi exercise has been shown in a prior randomized controlled trial to
improve depression symptoms and quality of life (QoL) in patients with heart
failure (HF), but correlates of these improvements are not well known. The
purpose of this secondary analysis was to explore whether tai chi is associated
with improvements in biopsychosocial and behavioural measures and whether such
improvements are correlated with improved depression and QoL.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants were n = 100 adults with chronic systolic HF
(mean age = 67.4, SD = 12.0; 64% male; 96% White; New York Heart Association
class = 1-3) randomized to a 12 week tai chi exercise intervention or health
education control. Constructs of interest included social support, exercise
self-efficacy, activity engagement, sense of coherence, and inflammatory
biomarkers. Tai chi was associated with increased everyday activity engagement
compared with the health education group (P < 0.05), but there were no group
differences in social support or sense of coherence. Among tai chi participants, 
improved self-efficacy was correlated with QoL (r = 31, P = 0.05), and there was 
a trend toward improved depression symptoms and social support (r = -0.22,
P = 0.13). Among all participants, controlling for intervention group, improved
sense of coherence, and inflammation (C-reactive protein) were associated with
improved depression symptoms, and improved self-efficacy, sense of coherence, and
frequency of activity engagement were associated with improved QoL.
CONCLUSIONS: Tai chi exercise promotes inter-related psychosocial improvements
for patients with HF. A range of biopsychosocial and behavioural variables are
relevant to mood management in patients with HF.

PURPOSE: Psychosocial factors have been linked to myocardial infarction (MI)
outcomes. Whether psychosocial factors affect post-MI long-term adherence to
secondary prevention recommendations remains uncertain.
METHODS: Patients ≤65 years (n = 616) were assessed for optimism, perceived
social support (PSS), sense of coherence (SOC), anxiety, and depression at
initial hospitalization for acute MI (1992-1993). Adherence to secondary
prevention measures was recorded in interviews 3-6 months, 1-2, 5, and
10-13 years after MI. Prevention score (proportion of recommendations met) was
developed based on: (1) medication adherence; (2) exercise; (3) nonsmoking; (4)
healthy diet; (5) maintaining recommended body weight. Associations between
psychosocial factors and prevention scores were estimated using Generalized
Estimating Equation models. The role of the prevention score in long-term
survival was assessed using time-dependent Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: Average follow-up prevention scores ranged from 0.70 to 0.80 (SD,
≈0.20). After multivariable adjustment, PSS (β = 0.087, P = .002, per 1 SD
increase) and SOC (β = 0.082, P = .006, per 1 SD increase) were positively
associated with secondary prevention adherence. The prevention score predicted
survival over 23-year follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.68-0.91,
per 1 SD increase).
CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial factors following MI, particularly PSS and SOC, were
associated with long-term adherence to secondary prevention measures.

OBJECTIVE: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a complex and often poorly
understood condition, and people with CRPS will have diverse beliefs about their 
symptoms. According to the self-regulation model, these beliefs (termed "illness 
perceptions") influence health behaviors and outcomes. Previous studies have
found that psychological factors influence CRPS outcomes, but few studies have
investigated CRPS patients' illness perceptions specifically. The present study
examined whether illness perceptions were related to pain intensity and other
relevant outcomes in people with CRPS.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 53 patients with CRPS (type 1 and type 2)
completed questionnaires assessing illness perceptions, pain, disability, and
psychological factors. Multiple regression analyses were used to determine
whether illness perceptions were associated with pain intensity, disability,
depression, and kinesiophobia, after controlling for possible covariates
(including clinical and demographic factors, pain catastrophizing, and negative
affect).
RESULTS: Negative illness perceptions were associated with greater pain,
disability, and kinesiophobia, but not depression. Specifically, attributing more
symptoms to CRPS (more negative illness identity perceptions) was associated with
greater pain intensity, and reporting a poorer understanding of CRPS (lower
illness coherence scores) was associated with greater disability and
kinesiophobia.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CRPS with more negative illness perceptions
(particularly perceptions indicating a poor understanding of their condition)
also experience greater pain, disability, and kinesiophobia. Future research
could investigate whether altering CRPS patients' illness perceptions influences 
clinical outcomes.

Post-traumatic stress disorder in volunteer firefighters: influence of specific
risk and protective factors.

Schnell T(1), Suhr F(1), Weierstall-Pust R(1).

Author information:

University of Applied Sciences and Medical University, Hamburg, Germany.

Background: Volunteer firefighters belong to a risk population regarding the
development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, given the frequency
of work-related trauma, PTSD prevalences seem relatively low. Protective factors 
appear to be effective and are the focus of this study.
Objective: We investigated the PTSD-prevalence as well as the influence of trauma
exposure and the impact of protective factors resilience and Sense of Coherence
(SoC) on symptoms of PTSD in volunteer firefighters.
Method: Data from 232 participants of an online questionnaire study were analysed
using a path model approach.
Results: 'The results suggest a possible prevalence of PTSD of 12.5% and 2.2% for
partial PTSD based on self-report measures. SoC and trauma event load proved to
be independent of each other, as no intercorrelations were found. But both
directly predicted PTSD severity. Higher resilience scores predicted the
participants' Sense of Coherence, but PTSD severity was only indirectly affected 
by resilience, which was entirely mediated by SoC. Further, although SoC and
trauma load increase with age and years of job experience, it is only SoC that
affects PTSD severity, not age or years of experience.
Conclusions: The results emphasize that not only exposure to potentially
traumatic events predicts the later probability of developing symptoms of PTSD,
but that the integration of stressful experiences into the self-concept
(associated with SoC) is essential for the development of PTSD. Future research
should address the question of causality between SoC and PTSD, and consider which
factors moderate the SoC.

Publisher: Antecedentes: Los bomberos voluntarios pertenecen a una población de
riesgo con respecto al desarrollo del Trastorno de Estrés Postraumático (TEPT).
Sin embargo, dada la frecuencia de los traumas relacionados con el trabajo, las
prevalencias del TEPT parecen relativamente bajas. Los factores protectores
parecen ser efectivos y son el foco de este estudio.Objetivo: Investigamos la
prevalencia del TEPT, así como la influencia de la exposición al trauma y el
impacto de los factores de protección de la resiliencia y el sentido de
coherencia (SoC en su sigla en inglés) sobre los síntomas del TEPT en los
bomberos voluntarios.Método: Se analizaron los datos de 232 participantes de un
estudio por cuestionario en línea, utilizando un enfoque de modelo de
ruta.Resultados: Los resultados sugieren una posible prevalencia del TEPT de
12.5% y 2.2% para TEPT parcial, basado en medidas de autoinforme. La carga de
eventos de trauma y el SoC demostraron ser independientes uno del otro, ya que no
se encontraron intercorrelaciones. Pero ambos predijeron directamente la
severidad del TEPT. Los puntajes más altos de resiliencia predijeron el sentido
de coherencia de los participantes, pero la severidad del TEPT solo se vio
afectada indirectamente por la resiliencia, que fue mediada completamente por el 
SoC. Además, aunque el SoC y la carga traumática aumentan con la edad y los años 
de experiencia laboral, solo el SoC afecta la gravedad del TEPT, no la edad o los
años de experiencia.Conclusiones: Los resultados enfatizan que no solo la
exposición a eventos potencialmente traumáticos predice la probabilidad posterior
de desarrollar síntomas de TEPT, sino que la integración de las experiencias
estresantes en el autoconcepto (asociado con SoC) es esencial para el desarrollo 
de TEPT. La investigación futura debería abordar la cuestión de la causalidad
entre el SoC y el TEPT, y considerar qué factores moderan el SoC.Publisher: 背景:

BACKGROUND: Smoking during pregnancy has serious consequences for maternal and
child health. An intervention package to embed National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence guidance (babyClear©) was delivered across maternity and stop
smoking services (SSS) within an English region, to support pregnant women to
stop smoking. We aimed to ascertain acceptability among pregnant smokers
receiving the intervention.
METHODS: Pregnant smokers who received the intervention and participated in the
study were interviewed, first at around 16 weeks of pregnancy (n = 17) and again 
several weeks later (n = 8) or postpartum (n = 3). Interview schedules were
informed by Normalization Process Theory (NPT) and Theoretical Domains Framework;
interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically, using the 
Framework method and NPT. Findings are grouped according to the four NPT
concepts.
RESULTS: Coherence: Carbon monoxide monitoring appeared to make sense; women were
motivated to quit by being monitored. Cognitive participation: When linked to a
professional discourse of caring and concern, some women were prompted to engage 
with the SS message. Women were more guarded in their reaction to initial contact
from the SSS; reporting attending appointments successfully, or in some cases,
experiencing problems that decreased engagement and made quitting harder.
Collective action: Where women continued to smoke or failed to attend SSS
appointments, an extra intervention was delivered, the Risk Perception Tool
(RPT), which often prompted pregnant women to act. Reflexive monitoring: Most
women accepted the need for a hard-hitting approach (RPT) and, while it
distressed them at the time, they claimed they were subsequently grateful for it.
SSS intervention post-RPT was seen as supportive, partly because it often
involved home visits. Aspects of family inclusion in babyClear© were reported as 
beneficial. In Trusts where women experienced services as less focused on
prioritising the stop smoking message, less well integrated or reported maternity
staff as less adept at delivering the RPT, women found babyClear© less acceptable
overall.
CONCLUSIONS: The babyClear© package was acceptable to pregnant smokers
interviewed during and shortly after pregnancy and, in some cases, to promote
quitting. However, some contexts were more optimal than others, leading to
variation in acceptability overall.

Drought is a threat to public health. Individual and community adaptive capacity 
is crucial when responding to the impacts of drought. Gaps remain in the
understandings of the relationship between wellbeing and adaptive capacity, and
whether increased wellbeing can lead to improved adaptive capacity (or vice
versa). This paper explores the relationship between drought, wellbeing and
adaptive capacity to provide insights that will inform actions to enhance
adaptive capacity, and hence increase opportunities for effective drought
adaptation. The theory of salutogenesis and the associated sense of coherence
(SOC) are used to measure adaptive capacity and to explain why some individuals
remain well and adapt to adversity while others do not. An online survey of rural
residents (n = 163) in drought-affected New South Wales (NSW), Australia, was
conducted from November 2018 to January 2019. Linear regression was used to model
the relationships between SOC, sociodemographic factors, drought and wellbeing.
Findings demonstrate that SOC is strongly correlated with wellbeing. Drought
condition did not influence adaptive capacity, although adaptive capacity and
drought-related stress were only weakly correlated. Increased wellbeing was found
to be associated with stronger adaptive capacity and therefore, an individuals'
capacity to cope with adversity, such as drought.

Using Biosignals for Objective Measurement of Presence in Virtual Reality
Environments.

Athif M, Rathnayake BLK, Nagahapitiya SMDBS, Samarasinghe SADAK, Samaratunga PS, 
Peiris RL, De Silva AC.

The concept of 'presence' in the context of virtual reality (VR) refers to the
experience of being in the virtual environment, even when one is physically
situated in the real world. Therefore, it is a key parameter of assessing a VR
system, based on which, improvements can be made to it. To overcome the
limitations of existing methods that are based on standard questionnaires and
behavioral analysis, this study proposes to investigate the suitability of
biosignals of the user to derive an objective measure of presence. The proposed
approach includes experiments conducted on 20 users, recording EEG, ECG and
electrodermal activity (EDA) signals while experiencing custom designed VR
scenarios with factors contributing to presence suppressed and unsuppressed.
Mutual Information based feature selection and subsequent paired t-tests used to 
identify significant variations in biosignal features when each factor of
presence is suppressed revealed significant (p < 0.05) differences in the mean
values of EEG signal power and coherence within alpha, beta and gamma bands
distributed in specific regions of the brain. Statistical features showed a
significant variation with the suppression of realism factor. The variations of
activity in the temporal region lead to the assumption of insula activation which
may be related to the sense of presence. Therefore, the use of biosignals for an 
objective measurement of presence in VR systems indicates promise.

Study for quantitative evaluation of photoaging with photoacoustic microscopy.

Hattori H, Namita T, Kondo K, Yamakawa M, Shiina T.

Skin aging caused by ultraviolet light exposure is one of the serious problems
from the viewpoint of beauty and healthcare. This is because ultraviolet light
can cause age spot, wrinkles, at the worst case, skin cancer and so on. To
evaluate skin aging, various modalities are being used, such as histopathological
diagnosis, optical coherence tomography, ultrasound examination (B-mode imaging).
However, they have disadvantages in terms of invasiveness, penetration depth and 
tissue specificity, respectively. To overcome these defects, photoacoustic
imaging (PAI), a novel modality was used in this work. This modality can sense
differences of tissue characteristics non-invasively. In this experiment, human
skin tissues in various generations (i.e. various degrees of photoaging) were
measured by using acoustic resolution photoacoustic microscopy (AR-PAM). To
verify the feasibility of quantitative skin aging evaluation with PA technique,
signals from sectioned human skin (cheek and buttock; female from 28 to 95 years 
old) were measured with PA microscopy. The effects of photoaging progress on the 
signal intensity were investigated. The results demonstrated that the PA signal
from the dermis significantly increases with aging progress (p < 0.05). These
analyses demonstrate the feasibility of quantitative skin aging evaluation with a
PAI system.

Cologne, Cologne, Germany.

OBJECTIVE: Although many cancer patients experience psychological distress, not
all affected patients utilise psycho-oncological care. We aim to examine the role
of generalised resistance resources (GRRs) and sense of coherence (SOC) in
predicting cancer patient needs for psycho-oncological care and its utilisation. 
A salutogenic prediction model was conceptualised and statistically tested.
METHODS: Survey data (response rate 88.94%) from 2270 breast cancer patients one 
year after treatment in one of 88 certified hospitals in North Rhine-Westphalia, 
Germany, were analysed. Structural Equation Modelling analysis was performed.
RESULTS: 21.6% of patients (n = 485; N = 2249) felt they currently needed
psycho-oncological care, of which 61.6% currently utilised it (n = 299, N = 485).
42.2% (n = 953, N = 2259) had the need for psycho-oncological care in the
previous 12 months, of which 58.0% (n = 553, N = 953) utilised it. Several GRRs
directly predict the need for psycho-oncological care and SOC, as well as
indirectly predict the utilisation of psycho-oncological care. Past utilisation
significantly affects current need and utilisation. The model shows good model
fit.
CONCLUSIONS: Generalised resistance resources and SOC affect the utilisation of
psycho-oncological care. Therefore, measuring key GRRs and SOC during cancer
treatment should be integrated into patient care as a salutogenic approach, to
identify resources and vulnerabilities on an individual level.

Development of a Generic Workshop Appraisal Scale (WASC) for Organizational
Health Interventions and Evaluation.

This study presents the development of a generic workshop appraisal scale (WASC) 
for the evaluation of organizational health interventions. Based on the session
evaluation questionnaire (SEQ) by Stiles (1980), we developed a short, generic
10-item scale with pairs of adjectives, covering five facets: comprehensibility, 
relevance, novelty, activation, and valence. Our study is based on N = 499
employees from four organizations who participated in 41 workshops and filled out
an evaluation questionnaire on-site. The questionnaire contained the newly
developed WASC, as well as items capturing satisfaction with the developed output
and outcome expectancies. Results from confirmative factor analysis confirmed the
hypothesized five-factor structure of the WASC. The factor structure was found to
be nearly invariant across the four organizations, a result that needs to be
replicated in larger samples. Analysis of intra-class correlations indicated that
25% of the variance in workshop appraisal can be explained at workshop level.
Hereby, perceived relevance and novelty exhibited lower amounts of shared
variance, indicating that corresponding workshop appraisals are influenced more
by individual factors and less by group dynamics. Furthermore, results from
mediation analysis revealed that participants' workshop appraisals were
significantly related to their outcome expectancies, and that this relationship
was mediated by output satisfaction. Again, the facets showed differential
effects: Relevance and comprehensibility seem to contribute most to the total
effect on outcome expectancy, followed by activation, whereas valence and
especially novelty play a minor role. Taken together, participants' workshop
appraisals - together with output satisfaction and outcome expectancy - may be
helpful for monitoring the implementation process and allow for corrective action
if necessary.

Although prior research has extensively documented the correlates of growth
mindset, little is known about its antecedents in undergraduate students. Guided 
by the self-determination theory, the current study investigated the association 
of perceived autonomy support (i.e., parental autonomy support and teacher
autonomy support) with growth mindset and assessed whether sense of coherence
mediated this association. A total of 1,030 Chinese undergraduate students (62.4%
females; M age = 20.44, SD = 1.52) aged from 18 to 25 years were involved in this
study; they were asked to fill out a set of self-reported questionnaires. Results
of the structural equation modeling showed that sense of coherence fully mediated
the association between parental autonomy support and growth mindset and between 
teacher autonomy support and growth mindset. More precisely, parental autonomy
support and teacher autonomy support were each positively associated with sense
of coherence, which in turn was positively related to growth mindset. The current
findings further confirm the beneficial effect of autonomy support on
individuals' adaptive skills in a collective cultural context, suggesting that
autonomy-supportive parents and teachers can contribute to undergraduate
students' growth mindset through the role of sense of coherence.

The aim was to synthesize the best scientific evidence on the effect of sense of 
coherence in disease development, treatment, and biomedical metabolic control
indicators, as well as the complications involved for people at risk of
developing diabetes and for diabetics. The systematic review method was
implemented. Search and selection efforts of two independent reviewers on Scopus,
Web of Science, PubMed, Ebsco, Science Direct, and manuals databases, available
until 2017, in Spanish and English, of the population aged 18 and over. From a
total of 154 studies, 20 articles were included in the systematic review. Over
half of the studies used the SOC-13 version to verify the sense of coherence and 
the most frequent indicator of metabolic control was glycated hemoglobin. In
addition to this, 14 of the 20 studies found a statistically significant
relationship between sense of coherence and diabetes. It is concluded that the
sense of coherence has a strong correlation with diabetes in the different phases
of the disease and is related to the reduction of risk for the development of the
disease, a reduction of glycated hemoglobin values, and the appearance of
diabetes mellitus-related complications.

personas en riesgo de desarrollar diabetes y en diabéticos. El método utilizado
fue la revisión sistemática. Búsqueda y selección por dos revisores
independientes en las bases de datos Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Ebsco,
Science Direct y manuales, disponibles hasta 2017, en español e inglés, en
población con edad superior a 18 años. De un total de 154 estudios, 20 artículos 
fueron incluidos en la revisión sistemática. Más de la mitad de los estudios
utilizaron la versión SOC-13 para la verificación del sentido de coherencia y el 
indicador de control metabólico más frecuente fue la hemoglobina glucosilada.
Además, 14, de los 20 estudios, encontraron una relación estadísticamente
significativa entre el sentido de coherencia y la diabetes. Se concluye que el
sentido de coherencia tiene una fuerte correlación con la diabetes en las
diferentes fases de la enfermedad y está relacionado con la reducción del riesgo 
para el desarrollo de la enfermedad, la reducción de los valores de hemoglobina
glucosilada y la aparición de complicaciones de la diabetes mellitus.

Examining mediators of change in wellbeing, stress, and depression in a blended, 
Internet-based, ACT intervention for university students.

A coach-guided Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention that uses a
blended approach of two face-to-face and five online sessions (iACT; N = 33) has 
been found to be more effective than a waiting-list control condition (WLC;
N = 35) at enhancing the wellbeing of university students while also reducing
stress and depression. The present study explored possible mediators of change
that may account for the outcomes of the study. Mediation analyses revealed that 
changes in the non-reactivity subscale of mindfulness mediated changes in
wellbeing, depression, and stress in the iACT group. In addition, changes in the 
sense of coherence subscale of meaningfulness mediated changes in all outcomes.
Psychological flexibility and cognitive defusion did not mediate changes in
outcomes. The results suggest that the use of practices focusing on
non-reactivity, meaning the ability to allow thoughts and feelings to come and go
without getting carried away by them, is especially important for enhancing the
wellbeing of university students. A focus on enhancing meaningfulness also plays 
a significant role in reducing psychological distress. These findings provide a
first step toward understanding the potential mechanisms of change taking place
in brief, Internet-supported, blended ACT programs.

Mental health professionals have a responsibility to ensure the best possible
quality of care. Family is strongly involved in the patient's everyday life. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between health care
professionals' perception of the quality of care, attitudes of family involvement
and their own sense of coherence. A descriptive quantitative study with fifty-six
health professionals, completed "Quality in Psychiatric Care-Community Outpatient
Psychiatric Staff", "Families' Importance in Nursing Care-health professionals'
attitudes", "The Sense of Coherence Scale-13". The health professionals perceived
quality as high and did not perceive the families as a burden.

Tolerability and psychological effects of a multimodal day-care rehabilitation
program for persons with Huntington's disease.

Ringqvist K(1), Borg K, Möller MC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Danderyd University Hospital,
Stockholm, Sweden. E-mail: karin.ringqvist@sll.se.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the psychological benefits of intense, inpatient,
multimodal rehabilitation for persons with Huntingtons disease (HD), as found in 
earlier studies, also apply in a shorter, day-care setting.
DESIGN: Prospective, non-randomized cohort study.
SUBJECTS: Twenty patients attending a group-based 8-week (3 days/week)
rehabilitation programme aimed at persons in early stages of HD.
METHODS: An explorative cohort study on register data from a specialized
rehabilitation centre, includ-ing descriptive data, number of cancellations, a
self-reported evaluation, and measures of psychiatric symptoms, health-related
quality of life, sense of coherence and physical function at baseline and at the 
end of rehabilitation.
RESULTS: Patients' attendance rate was almost 90%. Patients were satisfied, and
displayed significantly reduced anxiety and depression and improved
health-related quality of life after rehabilitation. Baseline measures of sense
of coherence showed significant negative correlation with the number of cancelled
days of rehabilitation. Physical function improved, but did not correlate
significantly with psychological outcome measures.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that an 8-week multimodal day-care
rehabilitation programme can be tolerable, reduce psychiatric symptoms, and
improve health-related quality of life for people with HD. A higher sense of
coherence seems to promote attendance rates. Further larger studies, including
the impact of cognition and disease progression on the treatment effect, are
warranted.

BACKGROUND: Persons with an intellectual disability are at increased risk of
experiencing adversities. The current study aims at providing an overview of the 
research on how resilience in adults with intellectual disabilities, in the face 
of adversity, is supported by sources in their social network.
METHOD: A literature review was conducted in the databases Psycinfo and Web of
Science. To evaluate the quality of the included studies, the Mixed Method
Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used.
RESULTS: The themes: "positive emotions," "network acceptance," "sense of
coherence" and "network support," were identified as sources of resilience in the
social network of the adults with intellectual disabilities.
CONCLUSION: The current review showed that research addressing sources of
resilience among persons with intellectual disabilities is scarce. In this first 
overview, four sources of resilience in the social network of people with
intellectual disabilities were identified that interact and possibly strengthen
each other.

Background: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and senses of coherence (SoC) 
can be affected by the use of tobacco. Hence, the aim of the present study was to
explore the association between HRQOL and SoC among health professionals working 
in primary health centers (PHCs) consuming Tobacco.
Materials and Methods: It was a cross-sectional descriptive study where sampling 
technique used was systematic stratified random sampling. Jaipur District has 37 
PHCs retrieved from site of NRHM Rajasthan. A close-ended questionnaire was
prepared to conduct the interview.
Results: Majority of study participants (57; 37.01%) were of 36-40 years of age. 
Males respondents (86; 55.85%) consuming tobacco were more in number than female 
respondents. Majority of study subjects (91; 59.09%) consumed smoked kind of
tobacco, in which most contributed were nurses (49; 62.82%). On applying a linear
regression model, it was determined that all subscale of SF-36 was significantly 
(P ≤ 0.000) associated with SoC.
Conclusion: From above, it was concluded that there was a strong association
between HRQOL and SoC among health professionals working in primary health
centers consuming tobacco.

RATIONALE: Research on positive youth development through sport is confronted
with a number of limitations: it lacks a clear theoretical basis of mechanisms
underlying life skill development through sport, it has a narrow focus on the
sports setting thereby neglecting the interplay between life domains in reaching 
positive youth development, and the mechanisms underlying the transfer process of
newly acquired skills and competences from the sports setting to other life
domains are unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to advance research in in this field by applying
theoretical insights from the salutogenic model of health to address the
aforementioned limitations.
INNOVATION: The salutogenic model of health describes how health and well-being
develops in challenging or stressful situations and offers an interesting
perspective on the mechanisms underlying youth developmental processes while
simultaneously aligning well with the tenets of the positive youth development
approach. The application of the salutogenic model of health offered a number of 
interesting theoretical insights to further understand 1) the mechanisms
underlying positive youth development through sport (i.e., enhancing
comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness), 2) that youth development
arises in the interaction between an individual's stressors, resources and sense 
of coherence across different life domains, and 3) the central role of both
generalized and resistance resources and sense of coherence in the transfer of
life skills between life domains. Given that sense of coherence plays a vital
role in the healthy development of individuals and the transfer of life skills
across life domains, it would make sense to strengthen the sense of coherence of 
youths in sports programs.
CONCLUSION: Based on this theoretical analysis, several recommendations and
considerations for further research on positive youth development through sport
are provided.

Resilience in Health and Illness.

Herzegovina, romana.babic@gmail.com.

Resilience is a relatively new concept that lacks clarity although it is
increasingly used in everyday conversation and across various disciplines. The
term was first introduced into psychology and psychiatry from technical sciences 
and afterwards thorough medicine and healthcare. It represents a complex set of
various protective and salutogenic factors and process important for
understanding health and illness, and treatment and healing processes. It is
defined as a protective factor that makes an individual more resilient to adverse
events that lead to positive developmental outcomes. Resilience is a positive
adaptation after stressful situations and it represents mechanisms of coping and 
rising above difficult experiences, i.e., the capacity of a person to
successfully adapt to change, resist the negative impact of stressors and avoid
occurrence of significant dysfunctions. It represents the ability to return to
the previous, so-called "normal" or healthy condition after trauma, accident,
tragedy, or illness. In other words, resilience refers to the ability to cope
with difficult, stressful and traumatic situations while maintaining or restoring
normal functioning. The higher the resilience, the lower the vulnerability and
risk of illness. Resilient individuals tend to be optimistic, have a tendency to 
see everything as a useful experience, focus on personal strengths and qualities,
use constructive criticism, develop close relationships with others, have
developed social skills, and are emotionally conscious. Good resilience
aggravates and prevents the onset of disease, provides good heath, facilitates
and accelerates healing, and provides productive life and a sense of well-being
despite chronic illness. Resilience experts believe that anyone can strengthen
their resilience and thus contribute to the advancement of health and, if ill,
ease the illness, accelerate and facilitate healing.

This article proposes to advance the connections between salutogenic theory and
assets models for health improvement. There is a need to integrate their use in
public health and health promotion so that their respective potentials can be
fully developed. This requires their synergies to be made more explicit so that a
more coherent approach can be taken to their utilization. A mechanism is
therefore needed that helps to raise awareness of them and their value as a
resource together. Bronfenbrenner's bioecological theory provides one framework
that can support better integration of salutogenesis with the applied nature of
assets-based models. This paper proposes a new 'synergy model for health' that
integrates key concepts associated with salutogenic theory-generalized and
specific resistance resources (GRRs/SRRs) and generalized and specific resistance
deficits and the sense of coherence (SOC). In doing so, it highlights those GRRs 
and SRRs which are assets that, either individually or collectively, help to
develop a stronger SOC. Higher levels of SOC can then support the transformations
of potential resources into available assets (that people can understand, manage 
and make sense of), capable of producing positive health development. The
proposed 'Synergy model of health' aims to contribute to a deeper theoretical
understanding of health and development through the integration of the key
elements of both salutogenesis and assets models. This can facilitate a better
contextualization of the ideas into public health policy and practice by making
the salutogenic theory more action-oriented and the assets model more
theoretical.

BACKGROUND: Atrial arrhythmias (ie, intra-atrial reentrant tachycardia and atrial
fibrillation) are a leading cause of morbidity and hospitalization in adults with
congenital heart disease (CHD). Little is known about their effect on quality of 
life and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in adults with CHD.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of atrial
arrhythmias on PROs in adults with CHD and explore geographic variations.
METHODS: Associations between atrial arrhythmias and PROs were assessed in a
cross-sectional study of adults with CHD from 15 countries spanning 5 continents.
A propensity-based matching weight analysis was performed to compare quality of
life, perceived health status, psychological distress, sense of coherence, and
illness perception in patients with and those without atrial arrhythmias.
RESULTS: A total of 4028 adults with CHD were enrolled, 707 (17.6%) of whom had
atrial arrhythmias. After applying matching weights, patients with and those
without atrial arrhythmias were comparable with regard to age (mean 40.1 vs 40.2 
years), demographic variables (52.5% vs 52.2% women), and complexity of CHD
(15.9% simple, 44.8% moderate, and 39.2% complex in both groups). Patients with
atrial arrhythmias had significantly worse PRO scores with respect to quality of 
life, perceived health status, psychological distress (ie, depression), and
illness perception. A summary score that combines all PRO measures was
significantly lower in patients with atrial arrhythmias (-3.3%; P = .0006).
Differences in PROs were consistent across geographic regions.
CONCLUSION: Atrial arrhythmias in adults with CHD are associated with an adverse 
impact on a broad range of PROs consistently across various geographic regions.

BACKGROUND: Many people move in and out of hospital in the last few weeks of
life. These care transitions can be distressing for family members because they
signify the deterioration and impending death of their ill relative and
forthcoming family bereavement. Whilst there is evidence about psychosocial
support for family members providing end-of-life care at home, there is limited
evidence about how this can be provided in acute hospitals during care
transitions. Consequently, family members report a lack of support from
hospital-based healthcare professionals.
METHODS: The aim of the study was to implement research evidence for family
support at the end-of-life in acute hospital care. Informed by Participatory
Learning and Action Research and Normalization Process Theory (NPT) we
co-designed a context-specific intervention, the Family-Focused Support
Conversation, from a detailed review of research evidence. We undertook a pilot
implementation in three acute hospital Trusts in England to assess the potential 
for the intervention to be used in clinical practice. Pilot implementation was
undertaken during a three-month period by seven clinical co-researchers - nurses 
and occupational therapists in hospital specialist palliative care services.
Implementation was evaluated through data comprised of reflective records of
intervention delivery (n = 22), in-depth records of telephone implementation
support meetings between research team members and co-researchers (n = 3), and
in-depth evaluation meetings (n = 2). Data were qualitatively analysed using an
NPT framework designed for intervention evaluation.
RESULTS: Clinical co-researchers readily incorporated the Family-Focused Support 
Conversation into their everyday work. The intervention changed family support
from being solely patient-focused, providing information about patient needs, to 
family-focused, identifying family concerns about the significance and
implications of discharge and facilitating family-focused care. Co-researchers
reported an increase in family members' involvement in discharge decisions and
end-of-life care planning.
CONCLUSION: The Family-Focused Support Conversation is a novel, evidenced-based
and context specific intervention. Pilot implementation demonstrated the
potential for the intervention to be used in acute hospitals to support family
members during end-of-life care transitions. This subsequently informed a larger 
scale implementation study.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Social and Preventive Dentistry, School of Dentistry, Federal
University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

BACKGROUND: Oral health research in children has focused both on identifying the 
risk factors for dental caries and on the impact the disease has on children's
life.
AIM: Identifying studies that used the salutogenic theory to investigate positive
aspects to promote a healthy condition in preschool children.
DESIGN: A literature scoping review was conducted to answer the question: 'What
has been produced in scientific literature about children's oral health with a
salutogenic theoretical reference?' The checklist preferred reporting items for
systematic reviews and meta-analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR)
was applied. The research was conducted on the databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web 
of Science with no language, design, country or date restrictions. Three
independent reviewers selected the studies to be included in the research,
extracted data, and assessed the studies' contribution to the review.
RESULTS: Among the 38 studies retained, 10 were included, those were published
between 2009 and 2018: five in Brazil, two in the United States of America, and
one in Canada, China and India, respectively. All articles were published in
English language. Nine studies investigated the relation between the
parents'/caretakers' sense of coherence and aspects related to the children's
oral health condition. One study investigated health factors among the parents of
caries-free children.
CONCLUSION: Salutogenic orientation must be included in oral health research, so 
that salutary and risk factors may coexist, contributing to a new perspective for
oral health promotion among children.

Background: Long-term musculoskeletal pain is a major, often undertreated,
disabling health problem among an increasing number of older adults. Reflective
STRENGTH-giving dialogues (STRENGTH) may be a tool to support older adults living
with long-term pain. The main aim of this pilot study was to investigate the
immediate and longitudinal effect of the intervention STRENGTH on levels of pain,
wellbeing, occurrence of depression symptoms, and sense of coherence (SOC) among 
community-dwelling older adults suffering from musculoskeletal pain compared to a
control group.
Methods: The study was semiexperimental with an intervention group and a control 
group. The effect of a single STRENGTH intervention was reported on the Numeric
Rating Scale (NRS) regarding pain and wellbeing. To evaluate the longitudinal
effect of STRENGTH, using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), the
Geriatric Depression Scale-20 (GDS-20), SOC-13 at baseline (T1), and six months
after the intervention/no intervention (T2), a total of 30 older adults, aged 72 
to 97 years (Mdn 86 years), were included consecutively and fulfilled the
intervention series (n = 18) or untreated controls (n = 12).
Results: The intervention with STRENGTH decreases pain (NRS 6 Mdn versus NRS 4
Mdn, p < 0.001) and increases wellbeing (NRS 7 Mdn versus NRS 8 Mdn, p < 0.001). 
After a six-month study period with STRENGTH, no longitudinal effect difference
was found compared to baseline. Compared to the control group, there was an
increasing trend between decreased pain level and increased SOC level for
STRENGTH intervention.
Conclusions: This pilot study supports STRENGTH's effect as a pain-alleviating
model that provides a decrease in pain levels and an increase of wellbeing in
older adults with long-term pain. STRENGTH dialogues could be a useful
intervention to provide individually holistic care in older adults living with
long-term pain.

Introduction: The aim of the study was to validate the Croatian version of the
Sense of Coherence 29-item instrument (SOC-29) within a nursing population.
Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted between December 2017 and June
2018 at the University Hospital Centre Sisters of Mercy (UHCSM) in Zagreb,
Croatia. A total of 711 nurses participated in this study. Internal consistency
reliability was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient (α), while the
structure of the questionnaire was verified by exploratory factor analysis (EFA) 
(method of extraction: principal component analysis (PCA)) and confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA).
Results: The instrument demonstrated high internal consistency (α=0.885). PCA
analysis has identified five factors that together account for 48% of the
variance. However, the observed factors could not be interpreted. In the CFA,
none of the models fitted well, although the fit of the three-factor model
(CMIN/DF=4.786, CFI=0.767, RMSEA=0.073) was slightly better in comparison with
the one-factor model (CMIN/DF=6.072, CFI=0.685, RMSEA=0.084). As the three-factor
model in PCA has been shown to be uninterpretable, and all three factors were
mutually positive and significantly correlated (correlation coefficients:
0.365-0.521), this indicated a single factor in the background. All items also
showed saturation with the first factor (accounting for 25.7% of the variance).
Conclusions: The Croatian version of the SOC-29 instrument successfully fulfilled
the necessary psychometric criteria for being used on the population of Croatian 
nurses. The study proposes that potential users use the single-factor structure.

Publisher: Želeli smo ovrednotiti, ali je hrvaška verzija dolgega vprašalnika o
občutku koherentnosti (SOC-29) uporabna v raziskavah na področju promocije
zdravja med hrvaškimi medicinskimi sestrami, zato smo si zadali za cilj oceniti
izbrane psihometrične lastnosti instrumenta v tej določeni poklicni skupini tako 
z vidika zanesljivosti kot tudi z vidika veljavnosti.Presečna raziskava, v kateri
je sodelovalo 711 medicinskih sester, je bila izvedena v obdobju od decembra 2017
do junija 2018 v Univerzitetnem kliničnem centru Sestre milosrdnice v Zagrebu na 
Hrvaškem. Na področju zanesljivosti se je ocenjevala notranja skladnost.
Uporabili smo Cronbachov alfa koeficient (α). Na področju veljavnosti se je
ocenjevala struktura vprašalnika. Preverjala se je najprej s preiskovalno
faktorsko analizo (EFA) (z metodo analize glavnih komponent (PCA) kot metodo
ekstrakcije dejavnikov) in nato še s potrditveno faktorsko analizo (CFA).Na
področju zanesljivosti je analiza pokazala visoko notranjo skladnost instrumenta 
(α = 0,885). Na področju veljavnosti je analiza PCA pokazala pet dejavnikov, s
katerimi se je skupaj dalo pojasniti 48,0 % variance, vendar opazovanih
dejavnikov ni bilo mogoče razložiti. Tudi ko smo PCA omejili na tri dejavnike,
teh ni bilo mogoče razložiti. V CFA noben od modelov ni najbolje ustrezal, čeprav
je bila ustreznost trifaktorskega modela (CMIN/DF = 4,786, CFI = 0,767, RMSEA =
0,073) nekoliko boljša v primerjavi z enofaktorskim modelom (CMIN/DF = 6,072, CFI
= 0,685, RMSEA = 0,084). Ker se trifaktorskega modela v PCA ni dalo
interpretirati, prav tako pa so bili vsi trije dejavniki medsebojno pozitivni in 
so bistveno korelirani (korelacijski koeficienti: 0,365–0,521), je to kazalo en
sam dejavnik v ozadju. Vse postavke so pokazale tudi nasičenost s prvim
dejavnikom, s katerim se je dalo pojasniti 25,7 % variance.Hrvaška različica
instrumenta SOC-29 je uspešno izpolnila potrebna psihometrična merila za uporabo 
v populaciji hrvaških medicinskih sester, njenim potencialnim uporabnikom pa je
predlagana uporaba enofaktorske strukture, ki jo je zagovarjal tudi avtor
instrumenta, prav tako pa so prednost enofaktorski strukturi dali tudi številni
drugi avtorji.

OBJECTIVES: Sense of coherence (SOC) is increasingly recognized as an important
health determinant, particularly for mental health. Part of the evidence comes
from informal caregivers in diverse clinical conditions. The extent to which SOC 
influences caregiving outcomes, however, is relatively under-researched in
dementia, particularly regarding positive experiences. We analysed the
association of SOC with dementia caregivers' subjective burden, psychological
distress and positive aspects of care.
METHODS/DESIGN: This is a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from the
Lisbon study of Families of Persons with Dementia, involving a convenience sample
of 99 primary caregivers of community-dwelling patients of neurology and
psychiatry services. SOC was assessed with the Orientation for Life Scale.
Measures of caregivers' outcomes were: the Zarit Burden Interview, the General
Health Questionnaire for psychological distress and the Positive Aspects of
Caregiving scale. Analyses controlled for demographics, caregiving arrangements, 
objective burden, social support, patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms and
dementia stage.
RESULTS: Lower SOC was associated with higher psychological distress (p = 0.001).
No significant associations were found for subjective burden (p = 0.081) or
positive aspects of caregiving (p = 0.688). Additional analyses showed that lower
SOC was associated with less emotional support (p < 0.001) and past psychiatric
illness (p = 0.044).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support previous research suggesting that SOC is
protective for psychological distress, and extend evidence to the positive
aspects of care in dementia. The cross-sectional design and small-scale
convenience sampling preclude both causality presumptions and generalizability.
SOC assessments may be useful to define subgroups of dementia caregivers at risk 
for anxiety and depression.

BACKGROUND: Some older persons develop a persistent death wish without being
severely ill, often referred to as "completed life" or "tiredness of life". In
the Netherlands and Belgium, the question whether these persons should have legal
options for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (EAS) is intensely debated. 
Our main aim was to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of older
adults with a persistent death wish without severe illness, as the lack of this
knowledge is a crucial problem in de debate.
METHODS: We conducted a survey among a representative sample of 32,477 Dutch
citizens aged 55+, comprising questions about health, existential issues and the 
nature of the death wish. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the group 
with a persistent death wish and no severe illness (PDW-NSI) and several
subgroups.
RESULTS: A total of 21,294 respondents completed the questionnaire (response rate
65.6%). We identified 267 respondents (1.25%) as having a persistent death wish
and no severe illness (PDW-NSI). PDW-NSI did not only occur among the oldest old.
Although qualifying themselves as "not severely ill", those with PDW-NSI reported
considerable health problems. A substantial minority of the PDW-NSI-group
reported having had a death wish their whole lives. Within the group PDW-NSI 155 
(0.73%) respondents had an active death wish, of which 36 (0.17% of the total
response) reported a wish to actually end their lives. Thus, a death wish did not
always equal a wish to actually end one's life. Moreover, the death wishes were
often ambiguous. For example, almost half of the PDW-NSI-group (49.1%) indicated 
finding life worthwhile at this moment.
CONCLUSIONS: The identified characteristics challenge the dominant "completed
life" or "tiredness of life" image of healthy persons over the age of 75 who,
overseeing their lives, reasonably decide they would prefer to die. The results
also show that death wishes without severe illness are often ambiguous and do not
necessarily signify a wish to end one's life. It is of great importance to
acknowledge these nuances and variety in the debate and in clinical practice, to 
be able to adequately recognize the persons involved and tailor to their needs.

BACKGROUND: During the last decade, there has been an increase in studies
describing use of mHealth, using smartphones with apps, in the healthcare system 
by a variety of populations. Despite this, few interventions including apps are
targeting older people receiving home care. Developing mobile technology to its
full potential of being interactive in real time remains a challenge. The current
study is part of a larger project for identifying and managing health concerns
via an app by using real-time data. The aim of the study was to describe older
people's usage of an app and to evaluate the impact of usage on aspects of health
and health literacy over time.
METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was employed. Seventeen older people
self-reported health concerns via Interaktor twice a week for 3-months and
answered questionnaires at baseline, the end of the intervention and at a 6-month
follow-up. Logged data on app usage and data on Sense of Coherence, Health Index,
Nutrition Form for the Elderly, Geriatric Depression Scale-20, Swedish
Communicative and Critical Health Literacy and Swedish Functional Health Literacy
were collected and analysed using descriptive and non-parametric inferential
statistics.
RESULTS: The median usage of the app as intended was 96%. Pain was one of the
most reported health concerns and was also the health concern that triggered an
alert (n = 33). The older people's communicative and critical health literacy
improved significantly over time. Regarding the scores of Sense of Coherence,
Health Index, Nutritional Form for the Elderly, Geriatric Depression Scale-20 and
Swedish Functional Health Literacy scale, there were no significant differences
over time.
CONCLUSIONS: The high app usage showed that an app may be a suitable tool for
some older people living alone and receiving home care. The results indicate that
the usage of Interaktor can support older people by significantly improving their
communicative and critical health literacy. Aspects of health were not shown to
be affected by the usage of the app. Further research with larger sample is
needed for evaluation the effect on health literacy, and which aspects of health 
of importance to support by an app.

The current study was carried out to investigate the effects of
compassion-focused therapy (CFT) on experiential avoidance, meaning-in-life, and 
sense of coherence (SoC) in women suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) due to the intimate partner violence (IPV).42 women suffering from PTSD
due to the IPV exposure were randomized to the two groups of experimental and
control (21 per group). All participants completed the questionnaires of
experiential avoidance, meaning-in-life, and SoC as pre-test measures. The
experimental group received eight sessions of CFT, while the controls did not
receive any treatment. After that, all subjects responded to the questionnaires
of experiential avoidance, meaning-in-life, and SoC as the post-test measures.
Data were analyzed using one-way repeated measures MANOVA.Subjects of the
experimental group indicated a greater reduction in post-test scores of
experiential avoidance, and a significant rise in the level of meaning-in-life
and its subscales including the presence of meaning-in-life and search for
meaning-in-life when compared to the controls. Nevertheless, there was no change 
in the level of SoC as a function of CFT.Applying CFT can result in reducing
experiential avoidance and raising the meaning of life in women with PTSD due to 
IPV exposure. CFT is highly recommended to strengthen the well-being of patients 
with PTSD and reduce the PTSD symptoms.

This Special Issue aims to explore the concepts of stress, coping resources, and 
coping strategies, which are rooted in several theories, such as the stress and
coping theory and the salutogenesis theory, and to understand how their core
constructs are manifested in various ethnic and cultural groups around the world.
This Special Issue includes 13 articles on salutogenesis and coping from
different disciplinary, socio-cultural, historical, political, and economic
perspectives. These articles address salutogenesis on the individual,
organizational, and societal levels. The empirical studies are based in different
societal and national contexts and refer to different ethnic groups within those 
contexts. Other studies examine international leaders in industry from a global
perspective and present a systemic review of the literature concerning
individuals in specific professions, such as nursing. The studies in the current 
Special Issue set the ground for continuing research toward even more
comprehensive theoretical grounds; studies that incorporate several theoretical
backgrounds and explore a broad theoretical model that may help us to understand 
successful adaptation in various contexts. In summary, results of studies that
incorporate these theories may promote our understanding of the effects of coping
resources and strategies, including acculturation strategies used among minority 
groups for positive adaptation.

We evaluated the association between health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) and 
intent to return home among former residents of Tomioka Town, Fukushima
Prefecture 9 years after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident to support the
recovery of the community after the accident. We conducted a questionnaire survey
asking residents about their intention to return to their original home, risk
perception for radiation exposure, HR-QOL using the HR-QOL Short Form 8 (SF-8),
and sense of coherence using the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-13). Among the
1029 residents, a total of 138 (13%) had already returned to Tomioka (group 1),
223 (22%) were undecided (group 2), and 668 (65%) had decided not to return
(group 3). Group 2 had poorer HR-QOL than groups 1 and 3, especially physical
function, body pain, general health, social functioning, and mental health. The
ratio of residents with a better sense of coherence was significantly higher in
group 1 than in groups 2 and 3. Our present study indicated poorer HR-QOL among
residents who were undecided about returning home. It is necessary to provide a
model for a multidisciplinary approach for the public during the recovery phase
of a nuclear accident.

This cross-sectional study assessed the overall symptom burden, including the
prevalence, frequency, severity, and distress of symptoms among hemodialysis
patients, and explored the relationship between demographic characteristics,
clinical variables, self-management, sense of coherence, social support, and
symptom burden in these patients. Herein, a regression analysis was performed to 
determine associations with symptom burden. The mean score of symptom burden
among the participants (n = 382) was 74.12, with an average number of 12
symptoms. The analysis revealed that self-management, sense of coherence, and
social support were negatively associated with the overall symptom burden. The
multiple regression model showed that 48.6% of the variance in symptom burden was
explained by meaningfulness, emotional management, daily urine output, subjective
support, gender, and manageability. These findings contribute to the knowledge of
symptom burden among hemodialysis patients and some new predictors
(self-management, sense of coherence, and social support) of their symptom
burden.

BACKGROUND: Dementia care is associated with physical, emotional, and monetary
impact on the informal carers providing unpaid care. Differences in the personal 
characteristics of caregivers may help explain the variations in the costs of
dementia care.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of caregivers' sense
of coherence (SOC) on direct and indirect costs in dementia care.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in community dwelling caregivers
of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Data of healthcare services were obtained
from clinical registries, and information was collected from caregivers regarding
their use of social care resources and time spent caregiving. The transformation 
of all costs into Euros was made assigning a fixed cost of 10.29 € /h and 16.24 €
/h for assisting in instrumental and basic activities of daily living,
respectively. Caregivers' SOC was assessed using the Orientation to Life
Questionnaire (OLQ-13). Adjusted regression models were developed, with different
types of costs as dependent variables.
RESULTS: A sample of 147 caregivers was recruited. The mean OLQ-13 score was 73.3
points (SD = 11.6). The regression models showed a small association between
caregivers' SOC and direct costs, mainly linked to the use of social care
resources (r2 = 0.429; β= -15.6 € /month), and a greater association between SOC 
and indirect costs (r2 = 0.562; β= -222.3 € /month).
CONCLUSION: Increasing caregivers' SOC could reduce dementia care costs by
decreasing the use of social care resources and caregiving time.

Background: Sense of coherence (SOC) has been associated with resilience to
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and seems to be a promising factor in
primary prevention of PTSD in high risk populations.
Objective: The present study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Dutch
revised Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-R) in a sample of N = 527 firefighters.
Method: To investigate the internal structure of this 13-item scale, a Mokken
scale analysis and an exploratory factor analysis were conducted (i.e. parallel
analysis based on MRFA).
Results: The combined results of these analyses suggested that a one-factor
solution with 10 out of 13 items was most compelling for our firefighter sample. 
Reliability estimates for the 10-item version increased compared to the 13-item
version (13-item: α = .82, λ2 = .83; 10-item: α = λ2 = .85). As expected, the
Dutch version showed positive associations with resilience (convergent validity),
and low correlations with neuroticism and extraversion (discriminant validity).
Conclusions: The one-factor solution of the Dutch SOC-R with 10 items (excluding 
item 2, item 3, and item 6) is most convincing. The use of this scale might be
specifically interesting regarding its potential to primary prevention of
trauma-related psychopathology in high-risk samples.

Purpose: The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between the sense of
coherence and self-perception of aging and the risk of depression among attendees
of the University of the Third Age (U3A). The influence of socio-demographic
factors was studied.
Participants and Methods: The study involved 315 attendees of the U3A aged on
average 68.4 years, age range 60-82 years old. The overwhelming majority were
women (91.7%). Cross-sectional research was conducted using standardized
questionnaires - the SOC-29 scale, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS - brief
version) and the author's own questionnaire regarding self-perception of aging.
Results: The study participants showed an average level of sense of coherence
(130.7± 23.2). The highest number of people obtained average results of sense of 
coherence, both in terms of global SOC (75.2%) and its components. The highest
scores on the SOC-29 scale were found for the sense of comprehensibility (41.3%).
The mean value of the self-perception of aging was 69.0±16.0 and indicates the
lower range of results for positive attitude. Nearly ¾ (72.1%) of the respondents
had a positive self-perception of aging. The values of the scale of
self-perception of aging showed a statistically significant relation to the
global level of sense of coherence and its components (p<0.001). In people
without depression, positive self-perception of aging was significantly more
frequent than among participants with depression of increasing intensity.
Education was significantly correlated with the results of the SOC-29 scale, the 
self-perception of aging scale and the GDS scale.
Conclusion: From the U3A research group, better educated elderly people have a
higher sense of coherence and show a more positive self-perception of aging.
Moreover, these people are less likely to show signs of senile depression.

BACKGROUND: Regular and consistent parental involvement in children's oral
hygiene practices is crucial to prevent oral diseases in young children. This
emphasizes the need for interventions targeting parental-supervised oral hygiene 
behavior. To inform the design of future interventions, this meta-analysis aimed 
to identify the parental social-cognitive factors associated with oral hygiene
behavior of preschoolers.
METHOD: Five bibliographic databases were searched. A study was eligible for
inclusion when it reported an association between a parental social-cognitive
factor and an oral hygiene behavior in the targeted age cohort. Meta-analyses
were performed when there were at least four independent effect sizes (k > 3).
RESULTS: Of the 5945 records identified, 25 studies contained eligible data to be
included in four meta-analyses: attitude (k = 12); self-efficacy (k = 12);
intention (k = 6), and sense of coherence (k = 5). The results showed that
greater frequency of preschoolers' oral hygiene behavior is significantly
associated with parental attitudes (r+ = 0.18), self-efficacy (r+ = 0.34), and
intention (r+ = 0.29), and not significantly associated with parental sense of
coherence (r+ = 0.08).
CONCLUSION: Self-efficacy, attitudes, and intention were identified as
significant correlates of parental-supervised oral hygiene behavior. However,
this is a limited evidence base and many social-cognitive factors, such as
self-regulatory processes including planning and action control, have yet to be
explored in this context. The significant social-cognitive correlates identified 
in this study, as well as potential other self-regulatory factors, should be
targeted in future intervention studies aimed at improving this important
preventive behavior.

AIM: In view of the current context of poverty and socio-economic inequalities
and the high and rising burdens of HIV infection and non-communicable diseases in
South Africa, this study aims to describe the distribution of adverse life events
(ALEs) by age and gender, and examine the socio-demographic characteristics,
psychosocial coping mechanisms, risky lifestyle behaviours and family burden of
HIV-related ill-health associated with ALEs in 25-74-year-old black residents of 
Cape Town.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a random cross-sectional sample, 12 ALEs, tobacco and
alcohol use, sense of coherence (SOC), locus of control (LOC) and impact of HIV
in the family were determined by administered questionnaires. Data analyses
included descriptive statistics adjusted for the realised sample. Multivariable
linear regression models assessed the independent associations of increasing
number of ALEs.
RESULTS: Among 1099 participants, mean lifetime score of ALE categories examined 
was 6.1 ±2.1 (range 0-12) with men reporting significantly higher number of
events compared with women (p<0.001). The most frequent ALE was the death of a
loved one (88.5%) followed by a major financial crisis (81.2%) with no trend
across gender or age group. In the multivariable linear regression model,
increasing ALEs were significantly associated with male gender, unemployment,
having spent >50% of life in urban areas, >7 years of education, problematic
alcohol use and poorer psychosocial coping mechanisms defined by low SOC and LOC.
All four variables pertaining to HIV-related burden of ill-health in the family
were significantly associated with increasing ALEs.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering that lower SOC and LOC and problem drinking were
significantly linked to ALEs, policymakers need to formulate strategies that
improve coping mechanisms and promote problem-solving behaviours, target the high
burden of alcohol misuse and address unemployment.

The COVID-19 pandemic can not only affect physical health, but also mental
health, resulting in sleep problems, depression, and traumatic stress. Our
research investigates the level of posttraumatic stress, perceived social
support, opinions on positive and negative consequences of the pandemic, sense of
security and sense of meaning among nurses in the face of this new and not fully 
understood global epidemiological phenomenon. For this purpose, computer-assisted
web interviews were conducted between May 1 and May 15, 2020. Participating
nurses completed the following research tools: The Impact Event Scale-Revised
(IES-R), The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), The
Changes in Outlook Questionnaire (CIOQ), The Safety Experience Questionnaire
(SEQ) and The Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ). Three hundred and twenty-five 
nurses of an average age of 39.18 ± 11.16 years and working throughout Poland
joined the study. The average overall IES-R score in the study group was 1.78 ±
0.65. Among the dimensions of traumatic stress, the highest score was obtained in
the "avoidance" dimension was 1.86 ± 0.73. Amongst participating nurses, the
highest support rates were provided by significant others (22.58 ± 5.22). Higher 
average scores were noted among participants in the subscale measuring positive
psychological changes (18.56 ± 4.04). The mean MLQ score was 5.33 ± 0.87. A
slightly higher result was observed in the subscale "presence" (5.35 ± 1.14). The
results of the research implemented during the period of severe psychological
pressure associated with the COVID-19 pandemic provided information on symptoms
of traumatic stress in the examined group of nurses. Their sense of security has 
been lowered and accompanied by an intensified reflection on issues concerning
security. However, their current sense of meaning in life remains higher than the
tendency to searching for it. The surveyed nurses received individual support
mostly from significant others (i.e., other than family and friends). They see
positive changes resulting from painful experiences related to the COVID-19
pandemic, which can be characterized by adaptation in the form of post-traumatic 
growth.

Wales, Australia. Electronic address: giulia.ulpiani@sydney.edu.au.

With the doubling of urban population within the next two decades and the
disproportionate growth of megacities, it is critical to explore the synergism
between urban heat and pollution. In this paper, a systematic review is conducted
on the existing knowledge, collected since 1990, on the link between urban heat
island (UHI) and urban pollution island (UPI). Results from 16 countries and 11
Köppen-Geiger climatic zones are perused and compared to delineate methodological
and experimental trends, geographical dependencies and research gaps. Detailed
content analysis is conducted according to five prominent topics: i) the role of 
UHI on temperature-dependent chemistry, ii) the daytime/nighttime variability in 
the UHI-UPI interaction, iii) the role of urban geomorphic types, forms and
growth schemes, iv) future trends and v) primary and secondary effects of UHI
mitigation on urban air quality. Different approaches and observations are
eventually harmonized to outline opportunities and challenges towards the
disentanglement and/or the two-way mitigation of both phenomena. This will help
governments and urban planners to deliver coping strategies and precautions
towards a more salutogenic urban design.

BACKGROUND: International research has indicated that teachers have an increased 
risk of mental disorders and work-related stress, compared with those working in 
other fields. In Japan, the deterioration of teachers' mental health has recently
become a serious social issue. Teaching is a high-stress occupation, and job
stress can affect teachers' physical and mental health. This study aimed to
determine how sense of coherence, job satisfaction, and workplace social support 
contribute to the mental health status of public and private high school teachers
in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan.
METHODS: The analytic sample comprised 370 high school teachers from eight public
and three private schools in Nagasaki Prefecture who answered an anonymous survey
comprising the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), which is a measure of
mental health status, and questions regarding sociodemographic characteristics,
occupational stressors, workplace social support systems, job satisfaction, and
sense of coherence. A multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify the 
predictors of mental health.
RESULTS: The survey was sent to 681 people, of whom 370 responded and were
included in the analysis (effective response rate: 54.3%). The analysis indicated
that sense of coherence was the strongest predictor of mental health (β = -.391, 
p < .0001), followed by workload stressors (β = .260, p < .0001), low job control
(β = .099, p = .021), and job satisfaction (β = -.088, p = .040).
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that a greater sense of coherence and job
satisfaction are associated with greater mental health. Meanwhile, workload
stressors and low job control undermined mental health status.

BACKGROUND: Caring for a person with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with 
significant mental burden e.g., depression and anxiety, and difficulties with
social, familial, and professional functioning. To date, few studies have
examined variables which would allow for a comprehensive and detailed study of
the relationship between personal resources and caregiver health status, with a
majority of studies focusing on factors that contribute to increased caregiver's 
burden. Moreover, the available evidence fails to address differences in the
functioning of formal and informal carers. Paying proper attention to the
problems of nursing home staff can help identify important risk factors.
Therefore, this study compared mental health problems in informal and formal
caregivers and examined the relationship between mental resources and mental
health problems in both groups of caregivers.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study examined 100 formal (n = 50) and informal
(n = 50) caregivers of AD patients. Personal resources were measured with the
Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ), the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES),
and the Sense of Coherence Questionnaire (SCQ), while mental health was assessed 
with the Depression Assessment Questionnaire (DAQ) and the General Health
Questionnaire (GHQ). Multivariate stepwise regression was performed separately
for both investigated groups.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between informal and formal
caregivers in terms of psychological variables, i.e., sense of coherence, social 
support, self-efficacy, or mental health problems. In contrast, there were
different significant predictors of mental health problems in both groups.
Comprehensibility (SCQ) was a significant predictor of mental health problems
measured by DAQ and self-efficacy (GSES) was a significant predictor of mental
health problems measured by GHQ in informal caregivers. For formal caregivers,
emotional support (SSQ) and comprehensibility (SCQ) were significant predictors
of mental health problems measured by DAQ, while tangible support (SSQ) and
meaningfulness (SCQ) were significant predictors of mental health problems
measured by GHQ.
CONCLUSIONS: Personal resources are significant predictors of mental health
outcomes in caregivers of AD patients. Preventive actions should therefore
include assessment of factors affecting caregivers' mental health in order to
provide them with necessary care and create appropriate support groups.

The legislative and ideological transition produced in recent years in Spain has 
favoured the implementation of the community model of mental health care.
However, there is still strong resistance to the inclusion of community
approaches in the care of people with mental health problems and to the
implementation of integrated care and attention with a salutogenic approach. The 
purpose of the following report is to describe the evolution of the community
model of mental health care in the Spanish National Health System and to assess
its current status. Initially, a review of the published national mental health
plans and strategies was carried out. Subsequently, the evaluation was carried
out taking as reference the Consensus Document on the Fundamental Principles and 
Key Elements of Community Mental Health, which establishes the criteria for
evaluating the quality of community care. In the absence of updated plans or
strategies, international reports and recommendations were included. The results 
were grouped into: 1) social perspective, where the controversy about the
capacity of the users to make decisions despite the recognition of their rights
as autonomous moral agents is evident; 2) perspective of the centrality of the
users of mental health care services, where the resistance to the implementation 
of integrated community care and attention is expressed; and 3) professional
perspective in relation to the effectiveness of the interventions and the
community network of care principles, which highlights the need to transform the 
institutions to carry out community interventions in mental health based on
evidence and in an intersectoral, comprehensive, integrated and integrating
manner.

OBJECTIVE: Salutogenetic aspects are valuable for consideration in
patient-centred care of advanced oncological diseases with a limited life
expectancy. The Milestone Communication Approach (MCA), involving physician-nurse
tandems, addresses specific challenges and needs over the disease trajectory of
patients with stage IV lung cancer and their informal caregivers. This study aims
to explore patients' and informal caregivers' salutogenetic experiences with the 
MCA concept.
METHODS: This qualitative study used face-to-face semi-structured interviews with
patients and informal caregivers. All generated data were audio-recorded,
pseudonymised and transcribed verbatim. Data were structured using Qualitative
Content Analysis. The material was coded deductively into themes related to the
components of sense of coherence (Aaron Antonovsky) and emerging sub-themes. All 
data was managed and organised in MAXQDA.
RESULTS: In 25 interviews, sense of coherence was referred to with all three
components: "Comprehensibility" was supported by information conveyed suitably
for the patients; "meaningfulness" was addressed as accepting the situation; and 
"manageability" led to advance care planning the patients were comfortable with. 
Patients and informal caregivers experienced the interprofessional tandem as an
added value for patient care.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants appreciate the MCA in its support for coping with a
life-limiting disease. Considering salutogenetic aspects facilitates prognostic
awareness and advance care planning. Nevertheless, individual needs of patients
and informal caregivers require an individualised application of the MCA.

Parents are a crucial part in the care of children with pediatric cataract. The
aim of this study was to explore and explain sense of coherence, family
self-efficacy, perceived social support, fatigue and parent reported experiences 
(PREM), in order to improve clinical care. Questionnaires were sent to the
parents of children registered in the Swedish national Paediatric Cataract
Register, PECARE, from 2006-2019 (n = 506). The response rate was 46% (n = 231), 
185 mothers and 44 fathers with a mean age of 40.39 years (SD ± 6.41 years). In
total, 38% of the parents reported severe fatigue, and mothers were more burdened
than fathers. Sense of coherence was strongly related to fatigue, especially
among parents of children with bilateral cataract. Mental fatigue and reduced
motivation explained 45% of the variation in sense of coherence. Being taken
seriously by the ophthalmological clinic explained over 60% of the variation in
satisfaction with care when controlled for parents' age and gender. In
conclusion, fatigue is important to take in consideration when interacting with
parents of children with cataract, especially those with bilateral cataract.
Being taken seriously is the key marker of satisfaction with care and support
from professionals. In addition to fatigue, the parents' age and life situation
affect how they perceive their own, as well as the professionals' effort, and
should be considered when tailoring family-centered care.

Recent interest in exploiting machine learning for model-free prediction of
chaotic systems focused on the time evolution of the dynamical variables of the
system as a whole, which include both amplitude and phase. In particular, in the 
framework based on reservoir computing, the prediction horizon as determined by
the largest Lyapunov exponent is often short, typically about five or six
Lyapunov times that contain approximately equal number of oscillation cycles of
the system. There are situations in the real world where the phase information is
important, such as the ups and downs of species populations in ecology, the
polarity of a voltage variable in an electronic circuit, and the concentration of
certain chemical above or below the average. Using classic chaotic oscillators
and a chaotic food-web system from ecology as examples, we demonstrate that
reservoir computing can be exploited for long-term prediction of the phase of
chaotic oscillators. The typical prediction horizon can be orders of magnitude
longer than that with predicting the entire variable, for which we provide a
physical understanding. We also demonstrate that a properly designed reservoir
computing machine can reliably sense phase synchronization between a pair of
coupled chaotic oscillators with implications to the design of the parallel
reservoir scheme for predicting large chaotic systems.

Postpartum depression (PPD) has detrimental effects on the health of the mother, 
child and family. Socio-demographic variables can influence PPD. Sense of
coherence (SOC) is a personal resource that mitigates the experience of stressful
events. We hypothesized that SOC would have a protective effect against PPD over 
time. The aim was to investigate the effects of socio-demographic factors and SOC
on PPD at birth (T1) and nine months postpartum (T2). A longitudinal study of
primiparous women (n = 114; age range 18-47 years) measured PPD, SOC and
socio-demographics at T1 and T2. The majority were married, had no economic
difficulties and were employed before birth. Results showed that PPD at T1
(15.8%) declined to 6.2% (T2). Job status was positively associated with SOC at
T1. The structured equation model accounted for 27% of the variance in PPD (T2). 
In the first pathway, job status was linked to PPD (T2) via SOC at T1 and T2. In 
the second, SOC and PPD (T1) and SOC (T2) mediated the link between job status
and PPD (T2). Results and clinical implications are discussed in the context of
the theory of conservation of resources. An intervention for enhancing SOC is
recommended for woman at risk of PPD.

Rescue workers present an elevated risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 
and recently, research has begun to focus on coping styles and social support as 
protective factors in this population. Associations in the particular group of
search and rescue dog handlers still lack evidence. The aim of the study is to
investigate if functional cognitions and social support also decrease the risk
for PTSD. Active voluntary rescue dog handlers (n = 116) rated levels of
resilience, sense of coherence, and social acknowledgment (SAQ; subscales general
disapproval, familial disapproval, recognition), in addition to a trauma
checklist and PTSD symptoms. Linear regression analyses and two different graph
models were calculated to explore associations, as well as potential pathways.
Controlling for trauma exposure, the SAQ general disapproval emerged as the only 
significant predictor in the regression model. In the graph models, SAQ familial 
disapproval was linked to SAQ recognition and SAQ general disapproval. The
latter, together with a sense of coherence manageability, affected PTSD
re-experiencing symptoms through resilience. The findings are in line with
earlier work. The study underlines the importance of targeting resilience and
manageability, as well as enhancing social support in prevention programs for
PTSD in canine search and rescue teams. Future research is warranted to further
investigate model stability and replicate findings.

Effects of the "Inspirational Lecture" in Combination With "Ordinary Antenatal
Parental Classes" as Professional Support for Expectant Parents: A Pilot Study as
a Randomized Controlled Trial.

Background: Both expectant mothers and their partners describe weaknesses in
ordinary parental preparatory professional support provided internationally and
nationally within Sweden. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the parental
preparatory professional support provided by midwives for expectant parents
within Sweden. This study will evaluate the effects on expectant parents of
receiving a combination of an "inspirational lecture" and "ordinary antenatal
parental classes" compared with only "ordinary antenatal parental classes."
Methods/Design: This block randomized controlled trial included an intervention
as a pilot study, in which expectant parents were randomized for (1) the
inspirational lecture and ordinary antenatal parental classes (intervention group
[IG]) (n = 66) or (2) ordinary antenatal parental classes (control group [CG]) (n
= 60). Data collection with repeated questionnaires was conducted in the first
week and 6 months after birth. Statistical analyses were conducted for
participant characteristics, differences between parents within IG and CG,
effects of the intervention, intention to treat, and internal consistency of the 
included measurements. Results: The intervention showed a tendency to be gainful 
for one out of four outcomes related to birth experience, and parents' perceived 
quality of parental couple relationship consensus and sexuality and
manageability. These results were more prominent for the partners. Parents within
both the intervention and control groups reported decreased social support in the
first 6 months after birth. Conclusion and Clinical Implications: Overall, the
concept of the inspirational lecture in combination with ordinary antenatal
parental classes as parental preparatory professional support seems to be a
valuable care intervention. However, this study was a pilot study and the results
should therefore be interpreted with caution. More research is needed since
childbirth and transition to parenthood are complex processes in need of
comprehension.

and meaningfulness in a group of Palestinian health care providers operating in
the West Bank and Israel.

Drawing on a salutogenic perspective, we explored sense of coherence (SOC) in a
group of Palestinian mental health care providers living and working in Israel
and the occupied Palestinian territories (West Bank). Specifically, we conducted 
a qualitative exploration of the cultural characteristics of SOC and its
components (comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness) in two groups
of Palestinian Muslim helpers. We found that context-specific features of SOC can
mobilize generalized resistance resources for coping with traumatic and stressful
experiences, even in an environment characterized by political instability,
military violence, and social trauma. Ten main themes emerged from the thematic
content analysis: acceptance, reacting to adversity, acknowledging human
insecurity (comprehensibility), self-control, talking to family, education as a
resource for survival, connecting to the severity of the event, responsibility as
a source of control (manageability), religiosity, and sense of belonging
(meaningfulness). The Islamic faith, as expressed through the concepts of Sumud
and Taslim, seemed to permeate individuals' ability to attribute meaning to
historical and transgenerational trauma, as well as to their ongoing traumatic
conditions, thus acting as their ultimate source of health and wellbeing. A
holistic, spiritual, and collectivist outlook helped respondents to approach
their lives with optimism. We discuss the implications for mental health care
providers and future research directions.

Objective: To explore the moderating effect of sense of coherence in the
relationship between occupational stress and depression. Methods: From June to
September in 2018, migrant workers were purposively selected from the urban
(including office buildings, shopping malls, barber shops or restaurants and
other service enterprises) and suburban (including microelectronics, internet,
clothing processing and art design and other factories) areas of Shanghai. A
total of 3 034 people were investigated and 2 573 valid questionnaires were
collected. Patient health questionnaire (PHQ), sense of coherence questionnaire
(SOC) and job content questionnaire (JCQ) were used to investigate the levels
depression, sense of coherence and occupational stress. Hierarchical regression
analysis was used to analyze the moderating effect of sense of coherence on
occupational stress and depression, and SPSS PROCESS macro program and Bootstrap 
method were used to further explore the moderating effect of sense of coherence. 
Results: The age of total 2 573 migrant workers was (28.24±7.33) years old and
49.79% of them were males. The scores of depression, occupational stress and
sense of coherence were 6.67±4.74, 28.45±4.38 and 62.02±10.89, respectively. The 
depression level was positively correlated with occupational stress (r=0.33,
P=0.007), and negatively correlated with sense of coherence (r=-0.53, P=0.003).
The hierarchy regression analysis suggested that the interaction between
occupational stress and sense of coherence was associated with depression symptom
(β=-0.07, P=0.001). Bootstrap analysis showed that occupational stress was not
associated with depression symptom with high level of sense of sense of coherence
(β=0.04, 95%CI=-0.01-0.10), while occupational stress was associated with
depression symptom with low level of sense of sense of coherence (β=0.19,
95%CI=0.14-0.23). Conclusion: The high level of sense of coherence has a
moderating effect on the relationship between occupational stress and depressive 
symptoms, while the low level of sense of coherence does not have this effect.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association
between sense of coherence (SOC) and periodontal outcomes. Electronic searches
were performed in 6 databases. Seventeen studies that evaluated the association
between SOC and periodontal outcomes were included. The included studies
demonstrated that individuals with a stronger SOC were more likely to present
improved periodontal outcomes. The meta-analysis showed that individuals with a
lower SOC were 3.31 times more likely to present bleeding on probing.
Sons/daughters of mothers with a lower SOC were 3.22 times more likely to present
gingival bleeding. Individuals with a stronger SOC have better periodontal
health.

Gender-based violence can include, but is not limited to, domestic violence,
intimate partner violence, rape, and intimate partner homicide. It is
well-established that gender inequality is the main driver of gender-based
violence. However, little work has attempted to unpack how gender-based violence 
perpetuates within the neighbourhood context, and whether 'liveability'
attributes might intersect with gender inequality and violence. We systematically
reviewed quantitative evidence examining associations between gender-based
violence and several liveability neighbourhood-level factors. MEDLINE (Ovid) and 
Scopus databases yielded 1822 potentially relevant articles. 50 articles met
inclusion criteria. Neighbourhood social capital was most consistently associated
with reduced gender-based violence. Few studies examined built environment
attributes (e.g. gambling venue densities, access to services). Future research
is needed to more deeply examine how combinations of salutogenic or pathogenic
neighbourhood attributes may reinforce or prevent violence.

INTRODUCTION: Osteopathic care may support an individual's adaptive capacity,
including allostatic regulation and tissue changes in both health and disease.
The palpatory findings which osteopaths claim are related to tissue changes may
be linked to allostatic load. However, this putative link has not been formally
investigated.
METHODS: We conducted a scoping review to critically appraise the relevant
literature on the relationship between allostatic processes and tissue
alterations. This review evaluates the use and relevance of palpatory findings in
osteopathic care. We searched on PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library for research
exploring the links between tissue adaptation, allostasis and osteopathic
palpatory findings (OPF).
RESULTS: Recent studies provide insights into the role of allostatic regulation
on body systems' responses related to tissue alterations. These results provide
new insights into the relevance of OPF to clinical practice.
DISCUSSION: We build upon the findings of our review to propose a putative model 
for OPF in clinical practice.
CONCLUSION: Although the clinical phenomena associated with OPF may be
biologically plausible, it lacks the necessary underpinning research evidence.
Arguably, the classical focus on the diagnosis of palpable tissue changes fails
to integrate biological, social and neuropsychological aspects such as stress
responses. Tissue alterations related to stress and allostatic load markers have 
been less studied. Tissue changes involved in the adaptive process may be useful 
to practitioners in the field of manual therapy, particularly in osteopathy. We
propose that OPF are one of the multidimensional aspects that may inform
osteopathic decision-making. However, they should be considered within a
biopsychosocial perspective and taking into account concepts of allostatic load
and regulation.

Adolescence is marked by significant life stress. Recently, school refusal and
dropouts as well as suicide among Japanese adolescents have increased. Sense of
coherence (SOC) is recognized as a competency that helps people deal with stress.
The purpose of this study was to examine the factors influencing SOC in male and 
female high school students. We conducted a survey with 203 pairs of high school 
students and their mothers, in Tokyo, to explore their SOC, family relationships,
school belonging, and autistic traits. Analysis of the data revealed a weak
relationship between female students' SOC and that of their mothers, and no
relationship between male students' SOC and their mothers' SOC. Feelings of
acceptance and recognition from teachers improved students' SOC, irrespective of 
gender. Low SOC in mothers had a negative impact on female students' SOC, and
children's lack of imagination (an autism spectrum tendency) had a negative
impact on male students' SOC. This study revealed the importance of support at
home and school according to the needs of both genders.

INTRODUCTION: It is claimed that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
has had a negative impact on mental health. However, to date, prospective studies
are lacking. Moreover, it is important to identify which factors modulate the
stress response to the pandemic. Previously, sense of coherence (SOC) has emerged
as a particularly important resistance factor.
OBJECTIVE: This prospective study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19
outbreak on mental health and to investigate the ability of pre-outbreak SOC
levels to predict changes in psychopathological symptoms.
METHODS: This study assessed psychopathological symptoms and SOC before and after
the COVID-19 outbreak as well as post-outbreak COVID-19-related traumatic
distress in a German-speaking sample (n =1,591). Bivariate latent change score
(BLCS) modeling was used to analyze pre- to post-outbreak changes in
psychopathological symptoms and the ability of SOC to predict symptom changes.
RESULTS: Overall, there was no change in psychopathological symptoms. However, on
an individual-respondent level, 10% experienced a clinically significant increase
in psychopathological symptoms and 15% met cut-off criteria for COVID-19-related 
traumatic distress. Using BLCS modeling, we identified a high-stress group
experiencing an increase in psychopathological symptoms and a decrease in SOC and
a low-stress group showing the reversed pattern. Changes in SOC and
psychopathological symptoms were predicted by pre-outbreak SOC and
psychopathological symptom levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Although mental health was stable in most respondents, a small group
of respondents characterized by low levels of SOC experienced increased
psychopathological symptoms from pre- to post-outbreak. Thus, SOC training might 
be a promising approach to enhance the resistance to stressors.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to explore the everyday life experiences and
perspectives on challenges related to pregnancy, childbirth and parenthood when
living with neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) and identify important elements to
take into consideration for parents and their health professionals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all, 27 people (17 with a NMD and 10 partners without a
NMD) were included in this study. The participants were all parents or expecting 
parents. Both mothers and fathers and ambulant and non-ambulant participants were
included to broaden the perspective. Three types of semi-structured interviews
were applied. The analysis was guided by the Interpretive Description methodology
and Antonovsky's Sense of Coherence theory.
RESULTS: The findings illuminated insights to ongoing challenges in the everyday 
lives of parents with NMD. Enforced Dilemmas represented guilt and dilemmas on
the possibility of passing on the NMD. Reflections on Bodily Ability symbolized
the effect that pregnancy and parenthood had on the body. Concept of Normality
signified the concerns the parents had about "not being normal enough."
Experience of Dependency addressed being dependent on others and No One to
Emulate how the rarity of the NMD made it difficult to find peers or seek advice.
CONCLUSION: The study emphasizes the importance of the professionals providing
counseling and support on pregnancy, childbirth, and parenthood either during
consultations, online or in structured professional and peer-support
rehabilitation groups for expecting parents or for new parents with a
NMD.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONProfessionals must provide knowledge and
counselling on pregnancy, childbirth, and parenthood to support families with NMD
who are expecting a child or have already become parents and address the illusion
of normal.Professional centralized and specialized units where people with NMD
can get advice on pregnancy and give birth should be an option.Structured
professional and peer-support rehabilitation groups (physical meetings or online)
on pregnancy, childbirth, and parenthood may be of value for the parents due to
the rarity of the diagnosis.Online information and knowledge on pregnancy,
childbirth, and parenthood and NMD should be widely available.Health
professionals and peers can help ensure and support an experience of
comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness among the parents with NMD
and develop rehabilitation services that meet the needs and preferences of people
considering getting a child or who are already parents with NMDs or other
disabilities.

BACKGROUND: When death ends a life, the impact of caring for person who suffered 
a period of illness or disease continues for significant others who are left to
grieve. They should be offered support to avoid complicated grief. This can be
provided in different ways and individually or in groups. This study aims to
describe significant others' experiences of participation in bereavement groups.
METHODS: Ten bereavement groups that each met five times offered support for the 
significant others of deceased loved ones who had been cared for by a
palliative-care team. After the five meetings, the grieving members (n = 46)
completed written comments about the role of the groups; they also commented one 
year after participating (n = 39). Comments were analyzed with qualitative
content analysis with a directed approach using the theory of a good death
according to the 6S's: self-image, self-determination, social relationships,
symptom control, synthesis and summation, and surrender.
RESULTS: Bereavement groups were found to be a source for alleviating grief for
some significant others, but not all experienced relief. Moreover, grief was
found to persist during participation. Another finding involved the impact of the
role of the palliative home-care team on bereavement support. To evaluate the
experience of participating in a bereavement group, the use the 6S's as a model
was a strength of the analysis. Bereavement groups could enhance the self and
offer relief from grief. Participation was described as social relationships that
offered a sense of coherence and understanding in grief. The effects of
participation were more meaningful close to the loss and could lose efficacy over
time. Bereavement support provided before a loved one's death was seen as
valuable.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the bereavement groups eased the grief of significant others
close to the death of their loved one. However, moving forward, several of the
significant others were not sure that their participation eased their grief. To
identify persons who may remain in a state of complicated grief, a routine of
planned contacts with the bereaved should begin before death and be followed up
later than six months after the death of a loved one.

Treatment and prevention alone are unlikely to make a significant difference in
reducing the burden of poor mental health and mental illness. Therefore, mental
health promotion (MHP) initiatives are advocated. In 2014, the ABCs of mental
health (ABCs) partnership was established in Denmark; in the partnership, partner
organisations, e.g., municipalities and NGOs, use a research-based framework for 
MHP, the ABC-framework, to develop and implement MHP initiatives. This paper has 
two aims: (1) to outline the overall characteristics of these MHP initiatives;
and (2) to explore local coordinator and stakeholder perceptions of the
implementation processes and the impact of the MHP initiatives. Questionnaire
surveys, individual interviews and group interviews were conducted during
2017-2020. The MHP initiatives were grouped according to three strategies:
building MHP capacity, campaign activities to promote mental health awareness and
knowledge and establishing and promoting opportunities to engage in mentally
healthy activities. The ABC-framework was positively received and viewed as
providing relevant knowledge for working with MHP as well as fostering
intersectoral and interprofessional collaborations. However, using a bottom-up
approach to develop and implement MHP initiatives can be time-consuming and
resource demanding, and it requires a deliberate balancing of local adaptability 
and concrete guidance when engaging stakeholders and implementers. Overall, using
the ABC-framework to develop and implement MHP initiatives holds great promise
for advancing and promoting MHP practice.

The aim of the study was to investigate the protective role of physical activity 
(PA) and other health-related bio-psycho components (physical fitness, body
composition, body perception and the sense of coherence (SOC)) in body
acceptance. We searched for gender differences in those relationships. We
investigated 231 adolescents aged 13-16 years from an urban area in Poland. We
conducted objective measurements of height, weight, fat% and relative value of
minute oxygen consumption. Questionnaires for PA, SOC Body Figure Perception and 
body acceptance were applied. Linear regression was used for analyzing
determinants of body acceptance. We found that more physically active girls
reported a less slim ideal vision of their figure (p < 0.05). Physical fitness is
a better predictor of body acceptance than physical activity. In the final model,
the sense of coherence, body mass index (BMI), and gender (being a boy) were also
predictors of body acceptance (F(6,92) = 13.084, p < 0.0001). Gender differences 
were discussed in the present study. Fitness enhancing physical activity should
be recommended for adolescents to achieve the protective psychosocial effect
especially among girls. Physical activity on a daily basis brings positive
results in a more adequate and reasonable body assessment and it can play a
protective role in terms of mental wellbeing. Body satisfaction varies between
genders and it is a more sensitive issue among girls than boys during
adolescence.

OBJECTIVE: Transient ischemic attack (TIA) has been reported to be frequently
followed by symptoms of post-TIA posttraumatic stress disorder (post-TIA PTSD).
Risk factors for post-TIA PTSD remain largely unknown. We aimed to identify
predictors of post-TIA PTSD development to enable post-TIA PTSD risk assessment
and inform future development of treatment and prevention interventions.
METHOD: TIA patients were examined twice for this observational cohort study.
Symptoms of post-TIA PTSD, depression and anxiety were assessed shortly after TIA
during in-hospital stay (T1) and three months after TIA (T2). The impact of known
general PTSD risk factors (psychiatric history, peritraumatic dissociation,
social support), psychological resilience factors (sense of coherence,
mindfulness, attachment style) and TIA characteristics (affected circulatory
territory, symptom type and duration) at T1 on post-TIA PTSD symptom severity at 
T2 was tested using hierarchical multiple linear regression.
RESULTS: Sixty-one patients (83.6%) completed the study at T2. Fifteen patients
(24.6%) were classified as post-TIA PTSD⊕ at T2. In multiple linear regression
analysis, age, sex, psychiatric history, peritraumatic dissociation and social
support together explained 39.9% of variance of post-TIA posttraumatic stress
symptom severity. Sense of coherence and mindfulness explained further 17.8% of
variance. Clinical TIA characteristics were not associated with post-TIA PTSD.
CONCLUSIONS: Post-TIA PTSD is a common phenomenon. General PTSD risk factors can 
be applied for post-TIA PTSD risk assessment. Sense of coherence and mindfulness 
are promising target variables for post-TIA PTSD treatment and prevention
interventions.

In 2014, the EU funded a four-year European Cooperation in Science and Technology
(COST) Action to address the topic of childbirth. The COST Birth Action was a
cross-European network, that brought together over 120 scientists, practitioners,
activists and policy makers from 34 countries to work on intrapartum care. The
central aim was to advance the state of research and practice in a specific area 
of great clinical and social importance, intrapartum care. The Action used inter 
and trans-disciplinary approaches to address birth from multiple perspectives and
drew on complexity theory and the concept of salutogenesis (wellbeing). This
special collection presents six papers produced from the Action and gives a sense
of the range and depth of the work conducted. The Collection illustrates the
knowledge that can be generated when a diverse group of people come together with
a similar goals and perspectives.

AIMS: This study aims at identifying the health effects of a strength-based
intervention on family caregivers of persons with dementia and to explore the
underlying mechanism. The perception of family caregivers on the strength-based
intervention will also be explored.
DESIGN: This sequential mixed-method study comprises a double-blind randomized
controlled trial and a descriptive qualitative study.
METHODS: A group of 372 family caregivers of persons with dementia will be
recruited from community settings. They will be randomized to receive the
strength-based intervention or a dementia education program. Based on
Antonovksy's theory of salutogenesis, the strength-based intervention integrates 
skills of narrative therapy and empowerment strategies. It comprises 14 weekly
group-based sessions and two bi-weekly follow-up telephone calls. The education
program serves as the control intervention. Validated instruments are used to
measure sense of coherence, coping, caregiver burden, and health-related quality 
of life at baseline, 14 weeks, and 22 weeks. Mixed-effects models and path
analysis will be used to identify the treatment effect and the mediating
mechanism. A subsample of 30 caregivers who report differential changes in the
health outcome will be engaged in qualitative interviews. The study was funded in
2017.
DISCUSSION: This study marks the first attempt to adopt a theory-driven
strength-based approach to improve the health outcomes of family caregivers of
persons with dementia. The stringent and comprehensive evaluation will inform its
effects and the underlying mechanism.
IMPACT: This study will have important theoretical and public health
implications. Theoretically, the study will enhance understanding of Antonovsky's
theory of salutogenesis by examining the modifiability of sense of coherence and 
the way it enhances health-related outcomes. In terms of public health
implications, the strength-based intervention focusing on optimizing the inner
strength can provide a new paradigm to promote the adjustment of family
caregivers of persons with dementia.

INTRODUCTION: The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has exposed healthcare
professionals (HCPs) to exceptional situations that can lead to increased anxiety
(ie, infection anxiety and perceived vulnerability), traumatic stress and
depression. We will investigate the development of these psychological
disturbances in HCPs at the treatment front line and second line during the
COVID-19 pandemic over a 12-month period in different countries. Additionally, we
will explore whether personal resilience factors and a work-related sense of
coherence influence the development of mental health problems in HCPs.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We plan to carry out a sequential qualitative-quantitative 
mixed-methods design study. The quantitative phase consists of a longitudinal
online survey based on six validated questionnaires, to be completed at three
points in time. A qualitative analysis will follow at the end of the pandemic to 
comprise at least nine semistructured interviews. The a priori sample size for
the survey will be a minimum of 160 participants, which we will extend to 400, to
compensate for dropout. Recruitment into the study will be through personal
invitations and the 'snowballing' sampling technique. Hierarchical linear
regression combined with qualitative data analysis, will facilitate greater
understanding of any associations between resilience and mental health issues in 
HCPs during pandemics.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study participants will provide electronic informed
consent. All recorded data will be stored on a secured research server at the
study site, which will only be accessible to the investigators. The Bern Cantonal
Ethics Committee has waiv ed the need for ethical approval (Req-2020-00355, 1
April 2020). There are no ethical, legal or security issues regarding the data
collection, processing, storage and dissemination in this project.

To Increase Mental Health Literacy and Human Rights Among New-Coming,
Low-Educated Mothers With Experience of War: A Culturally, Tailor-Made Group
Health Promotion Intervention With Participatory Methodology Addressing
Indirectly the Children.

Ekblad S(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Learning, Informatics, Management and Ethics, Cultural Medicine,
Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

Due to the increasing numbers of newcomers with impacts of war, civil war and
persecution, at high risk of trauma-related mental health problems, there is a
need for increase the poor mental health literacy (MHL) and human rights among
the new-comers, especially low-educated mothers with children. This article aimed
to present a case study report of several years' experience of tailor-made group 
health promotion intervention. It describes as an example, a project during
autumn 2018 in five municipalities of Sweden and in collaboration between
academia, primary care, social welfare, police, and an NGO. Fifty-one women,
Arabic- or Somalian speaking, with 1-7 children, mean age 40 years, low-educated 
and in average four years' of living in Sweden participated. Under supervision, a
local female member of the NGO coordinated the group meetings in Swedish with up 
to ten participants and the moderators were representatives of healthcare, social
services and police/lawyer, with an interpreter present. Each intervention
focused on human rights, health including mental health, psychosocial and
parenting support, by using a 5-week group intervention a 2 h/week, totally 10 h 
excluding pre- and post-evaluation, and one language per intervention. Each
meeting included 1-h lecture and after a short break with refreshments, the
participants asked questions to the respective moderator. It was a mixed method
but emphasis on qualitative design and participatory methodology with co-creation
and evaluation of the intervention. The results showed that this tailor-made
group intervention gave the participants empowerment and a sense of coherence,
MHL and tools to deal with stress/anxiety, based on their needs that were mapped 
before in a pilot study during Spring 2018, indirectly addressing their children.
However, they did not primarily talk about mental illness experience. It is vital
that these interventions toward the target group with limited exposure to Western
concepts (e.g., illness, anxiety, and trauma), may bridge the gap between Western
and traditional cultural understanding of pre- and postmigration stress. In
conclusion, MHL may be a function of both the cultural origin of the target
group's background and their resettlement in a Western reception country.
Implications are discussed.

Vaccine hesitancy may be more common among parents of children with autism
spectrum disorder (ASD). We examined factors associated with ASD-specific vaccine
hesitancy among caregivers of children with ASD who participated in the SPARK
study (Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research for Knowledge). 225
participants completed an online survey containing the Parent Attitudes About
Childhood Vaccines (PACV) questionnaire (measure of vaccine hesitancy) and the
Illness Perception Questionnaire revised for parents of children with ASD
(IPQ-R-ASD; measure of parents' views about ASD). 65 participants (28.8%) were
vaccine hesitant (PACV score ≥ 50); children of vaccine-hesitant parents (VHPs)
were less likely to be first born (n = 27, 41.5%), had greater ASD-symptom
severity (mean Social Communication Questionnaire score = 23.9, SD = 6.9), and
were more likely to have experienced developmental regression (n = 27, 50.9%) or 
plateau (n = 37, 69.8%). Compared to non-hesitant parents, VHPs significantly
more often endorsed accident/injury, deterioration of the child's immune system, 
diet, environmental pollution, general stress, parents' negative views, parents' 
behaviors/decisions, parents' emotional state, and vaccines as causes for ASD.
VHPs also had higher scores on the Personal Control, Treatment Control, Illness
Coherence, and Emotional Representations subscales of the IPQ-R than did
non-hesitant parents. In the final model, ASD-related vaccine hesitancy was
significantly associated with higher scores on the Emotional Representations
subscale (OR = 1.13, p = 0.10), agreement with deterioration of the child's
immunity as a cause of ASD (OR = 12.47, p < 0.001), the child not having achieved
fluent speech (OR = 2.67, p = 0.17), and the child experiencing a developmental
plateau (OR = 3.89, p = 0.002). Findings suggest that a combination of child
functioning and developmental history, as well as parents' negative views about
and their sense of control over ASD, influence vaccine hesitancy among parents of
children with ASD.

Chocolate is a widely appreciated foodstuff with historical appreciation as a
food from the gods. In addition to its highly palatable taste, it is a rich
source of (poly)phenolics, which have several proposed salutogenic effects,
including neuroprotective anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and cardioprotective
capabilities. Despite the known benefits of this ancient foodstuff, there is a
paucity of information on the effects of chocolate in the context of chronic
kidney disease (CKD). This review focusses on the potential salutogenic
contribution of chocolate intake, to mitigate inflammatory and oxidative burden
in CKD, its potential, for cardiovascular protection and on the maintenance of
diversity in gut microbiota, as well as clinical perspectives, on regular
chocolate intake by CKD patients.

Health-care workers operating in conflict zones are at severe risk of
psychological consequences, given their extended exposure to traumatic events
under conditions of stress and violence. This quantitative, cross-sectional study
was designed to explore the relationships between personal resources (sources of 
functioning)-operationalized as sense of coherence, posttraumatic growth, and
perceived well-being-psychological distress, and trauma symptoms in a specific
population of health workers exposed to war and violence. Palestinian health
professionals (N = 181) completed quantitative measures of well-being,
posttraumatic growth, sense of coherence, psychological distress, and traumatic
response. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The
outcomes suggest that sources of psychological functioning consistently play a
role in the mental health of different types of health professionals. Health-care
workers in an environment characterized by instability and ongoing risk need to
protect their own mental health by mobilizing sources of resistance and
resilience, such as a sense of coherence, subjective well-being, and growth. We
discuss the clinical implications of these findings and offer recommendations for
training and supervision. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights

With improvements in treatments for primary tumor and brain metastases (BM), the 
life expectancy of patients with advanced cancers is increasing; thus, helping
patients with BM maintain quality of life is becoming increasingly important.
Sense of coherence (SOC) has been found to be closely related to health-related
quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with chronic diseases, however, this
relationship has not been validated in patients with BM. This study first
examined the relationship between SOC and HRQoL in patients with BM, and further 
identified factors associated with SOC in these patients. Patients with BM
reported lower scores for most of the functioning subscales and for the general
rating of quality of life, and higher scores for most of the symptom subscales,
compared with a normative sample. SOC was significantly correlated with most
aspects of HRQoL in patients with BM. Further, SOC in the patients was associated
with awareness of the disease, possession of religious belief, and type of
primary cancer. These results validate the close relationship between SOC and
HRQoL in patients with BM, and indicate that SOC is associated with awareness of 
illness and religious belief.

On the Assessment of Functional Connectivity in an Immersive Brain-Computer
Interface During Motor Imagery.

Studies (Cinvestav) at Monterrey, Apodaca, Mexico.

New trends on brain-computer interface (BCI) design are aiming to combine this
technology with immersive virtual reality in order to provide a sense of realism 
to its users. In this study, we propose an experimental BCI to control an
immersive telepresence system using motor imagery (MI). The system is immersive
in the sense that the users can control the movement of a NAO humanoid robot in a
first person perspective (1PP), i.e., as if the movement of the robot was his/her
own. We analyze functional brain connectivity between 1PP and 3PP during the
control of our BCI using graph theory properties such as degree, betweenness
centrality, and efficiency. Changes in these metrics are obtained for the case of
the 1PP, as well as for the traditional third person perspective (3PP) in which
the user can see the movement of the robot as feedback. As proof-of-concept,
electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded from two subjects while they
performed MI to control the movement of the robot. The graph theoretical analysis
was applied to the binary directed networks obtained through the partial directed
coherence (PDC). In our preliminary assessment we found that the efficiency in
the α brain rhythm is greater in 1PP condition in comparison to the 3PP at the
prefrontal cortex. Also, a stronger influence of signals measured at EEG channel 
C3 (primary motor cortex) to other regions was found in 1PP condition.
Furthermore, our preliminary results seem to indicate that α and β brain rhythms 
have a high indegree at prefrontal cortex in 1PP condition, and this could be
possibly related to the experience of sense of agency. Therefore, using the PDC
combined with graph theory while controlling a telepresence robot in an immersive
system may contribute to understand the organization and behavior of brain
networks in these environments.

Based on the well-established job demands-resources (JD-R) framework, in our
study we introduce the novel study demands-resources (SD-R) framework. The SD-R
framework allows the study of salutogenic and pathogenic effects of university
settings on students' health and well-being. Using a large sample of university
students (n = 5660), our aim was to translate and validate the JD-R's essential
assumptions within the university context, and thus establish the SD-R framework.
We performed structural equation modelling to examine these essential
assumptions. As assumed, we found that study demands-the "bad things" at
university-predict student burnout (β = 0.50), whereas study resources-the "good 
things" at university-predict student engagement (β = 0.70) as well as burnout (β
= -0.35). Also, in line with the SD-R's assumptions, student burnout predicts
life satisfaction negatively (β = -0.34), whereas student engagement predicts
life satisfaction positively (β = 0.29). Hence, we were able to introduce the
novel SD-R framework and validate its core assumptions. The SD-R framework serves
as an excellent theoretical basis to examine both the salutogenic and pathogenic 
effects of the study context on students' health and well-being. However, the
framework needs further longitudinal and meta-analytical verification in
accordance with the research on the JD-R framework.

Activity-based workplaces (ABWs) are implemented with possible implications for
health, well-being, and work satisfaction in the workplace. Drawing on the
theoretical framework, i.e., sense of coherence (SOC), the aim was to investigate
how indicators pf SOC-meaningfulness, manageability and comprehensibility-are
associated with, or function as barriers or facilitators for, health, well-being 
and work satisfaction during relocation to an ABW. We followed the implementation
of ABWs at the Swedish Transport Administration (2018-2019). Questionnaires were 
administered before (n = 536), 3 months (n = 409) and 9 months (n = 373) after
relocation. Focus group interviews (15) were conducted before and after. Data
were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and content analysis. Relocation to
an ABW was associated with a reduced work satisfaction (physical p < 0.001;
psychosocial p < 0.001), and minor changes in health and occupational well-being 
during relocation (p > 0.001). The reduction in work satisfaction was smaller
among employees with high meaningfulness in the relocation process (p < 0.001).
All SOC indicators were positively associated with overall health, well-being and
work satisfaction (p < 0.001). Interviews suggested that meaningfulness was
facilitated by participation in the presented activities and that communication
before relocation was crucial. The results indicate that organizations
implementing ABWs should promote perceived meaningfulness in the process to
mitigate possible declines in satisfaction with the physical and psychosocial
work environment.

BACKGROUND: Recovery from substance use disorders without treatment has long been
of interest to researchers and practitioners. The aim of the study was to examine
the role of sense of coherence and recovery capital in long-term recovery without
treatment and the association between the two concepts.
METHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 229 Israeli respondents,
134 of them self-changers and 95 treatment-changers. The respondents completed
the Addiction Severity Index, the Sense of Coherence Questionnaire, the Childhood
Trauma Questionnaire, and the Recovery Capital Questionnaire.
RESULTS: Significant differences between the two groups were found. The
self-changers had a higher sense of coherence (p < .001) and reported more
cannabis use. No significant group differences were found in recovery capital.
The treatment-changers had experienced significantly more child abuse (p < .001) 
and suffered from severe psychiatric problems (p = .019), compared with the
self-changers. Significant correlations were found between higher sense of
coherence and lower psychiatric severity (p < .001), lower rate of child abuse (p
< .001), and self-change (p = .037). A strong relationship was found between
sense of coherence and recovery capital (p < .001), showing that the two concepts
were moderately to highly interrelated.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings signify the central role of sense of coherence in
recovery and the importance of strengthening sense of coherence, which may
promote health-related outcomes.

This randomized control trial used intent-to-treat analyses to compare parent
management training-Oregon model (PMTO) (N = 64) to family-based services as
usual (SAU) (N = 62) in 3.5-13-year-old children and their families in Denmark.
Outcomes were parent report of child internalizing and externalizing problems,
parenting efficacy, parenting stress, parent sense of coherence, parent-report of
life satisfaction, and parental depressive symptoms. Outcomes were measured at
pretreatment, post-treatment, and 18-20 months post-treatment. Results
demonstrated that both PMTO and family-based SAU resulted in significant
improvements in child externalizing and internalizing problems, parenting
efficacy, as well as parent-reported stress and depressive symptoms, life
satisfaction, and aspects of sense of cohesion. Effect sizes at post-treatment
and follow-up were in the small to moderate range, consistent with prior PMTO
evaluations. However, there were no significant differences between PMTO and
family-based SAU. Further research on the process and content of family-based SAU
is needed to determine how this approach overlaps with and is distinct from PMTO.

This study aimed at qualitatively exploring the development of a sense of
coherence (SOC) among systemic family therapist trainees (FTT) over a 3-year
period. It was conducted in a private family therapy training institute in
central Germany. The sample consisted of 66 trainees. The components of SOC and
their general health played an important role in the development of FTTs
throughout the three training years. Findings show that the SOC component of
meaningfulness (motivation) was most frequently mentioned and most important to
participants' personal and professional development, followed by
comprehensibility (understanding of self, others and the context) and finally by 
manageability (coping with challenges based on personal, social and professional 
resources). The three SOC components fostered a positive self-care approach in
FTTs and improved health and well-being over the 3 years. Visions of FTT at the
end of the training show that they aim at personal and professional growth and
development in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR).

BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 is a strong
reminder that the lockdown period has changed the way that people and communities
live, work, and interact, and it's necessary to make resilient the built
environment, both outdoor and mainly the indoor spaces: housing, workplaces,
public buildings, and entertainment facilities. How can we re-design the concept 
of Well-being and Public Health in relation to the living places of the future?
METHODS: According to the previous statements and scenario, this paper aims to
integrate the building hygiene and well-being, focusing the possible responses,
both existing and for the new buildings, taking home a strong message from this
"period" of physical distancing.
RESULTS: The Well-being and Public Health recommendations for a healthy, safe,
and sustainable housing are framed into the following key points: 1. Visible and 
accessible green elements and spaces; 2. Flexibility, adaptability, sharing, and 
crowding of living spaces, and compliant functions located into the buildings; 3.
Re-appropriation of the basic principles and archetypes of sustainable
architecture, thermal comfort and Indoor Air Quality (IAQ); 4. Water consumption 
and Wastewater Management; 5. Urban Solid Waste Management; 6. Housing automation
and electromagnetic fields; 7. Indoor building and finishing materials.
CONCLUSIONS: The Well-being and Public Health recommendations for a healthy, safe
and sustainable housing may provide a useful basis for Designers, Policy Makers
(fostering tax incentives for building renewal), Public Health experts and Local 
Health Agencies, in promoting actions and policies aimed to transform living
places in healthier and Salutogenic spaces.

Aim: To investigate the association between nurse-patient interaction and sense
of coherence among cognitively intact nursing home residents. Method: In a
cross-sectional design, data were collected in 2017 and 2018 using the
Nurse-Patient Interaction Scale (NPIS) and the 13-item Sense of Coherence Scale
(SOC-13). Of the 204 cognitively intact nursing home residents who met the
inclusion criteria, 188 (92%) participated, representing 27 nursing homes.
Multiple regression in a general linear model estimated the possible effects of
the 14 NPIS items on SOC-13 sum score, the possible effects of the NPIS (sum
score) on SOC-13 (sum score) as well as on the subdimensions of SOC-13,
comprehensibility, meaningfulness, and manageability (both without and with
adjusting for sex and age). Results: Four of the 14 NPIS items revealed highly
significant correlations with SOC-13 (sum score; unadjusted and adjusted for age 
and gender). Furthermore, the analysis adjusted for age and gender showed
significant associations for NPIS (sum score) with SOC-13 (sum score),
manageability, and comprehensibility. The correlation between NPIS and
meaningfulness was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Nurse-patient
interaction is significantly associated with SOC-13 and its subdimensions of
comprehensibility and manageability but not meaningfulness. Nurse-patient
interaction might be an important resource in relation to residents' sense of
coherence and its subdimensions.

PURPOSE: Needle placement is a challenging problem for applications such as
biopsy or brachytherapy. Tip force sensing can provide valuable feedback for
needle navigation inside the tissue. For this purpose, fiber-optical sensors can 
be directly integrated into the needle tip. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)
can be used to image tissue. Here, we study how to calibrate OCT to sense forces,
e.g., during robotic needle placement.
METHODS: We investigate whether using raw spectral OCT data without a typical
image reconstruction can improve a deep learning-based calibration between
optical signal and forces. For this purpose, we consider three different needles 
with a new, more robust design which are calibrated using convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). We compare training the CNNs with the raw OCT signal and the
reconstructed depth profiles.
RESULTS: We find that using raw data as an input for the largest CNN model
outperforms the use of reconstructed data with a mean absolute error of 5.81 mN
compared to 8.04 mN.
CONCLUSIONS: We find that deep learning with raw spectral OCT data can improve
learning for the task of force estimation. Our needle design and calibration
approach constitute a very accurate fiber-optical sensor for measuring forces at 
the needle tip.

The Five Diaphragms in Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine: Neurological
Relationships, Part 2.

Bordoni B(1).

Author information:

ITA.

The main objective of the osteopath and that of osteopathic manipulative medicine
(OMM) is to create space between the different tissues. The sliding capacity of
the various tissue layers and between the different body components, up to the
possibility of movement between cells is the salutogenic stimulus to allow the
circulation of fluids, the biochemical exchange, and the adequate management of
the multiple internal and external stimuli that perturb the body living. Movement
is allowed by space and space is life. In this second part, the exposure of the
anatomical neurological relationships of the five diaphragms continues,
highlighting the relationships of the thoracic outlet, the respiratory diaphragm,
and the pelvic floor. Finally, there will be clinical reflections to further
corroborate the existence of the anatomical continuum and to lay the scientific
foundations for an OMM approach to body diaphragms.

Introduction: This study investigated the relationship between personal and
family resources (i.e., social support, family functioning, self-efficacy in
care, sense of coherence and perceived burden of care) and depressive and anxiety
symptoms in women during the puerperium, adjusting for stressors. Methods: This
is a quantitative research design, carried out through a descriptive,
cross-sectional correlation study. This study includes 212 women over the age of 
19 who gave birth from March to September 2019 in Maternal and Child Hospital of 
Jaén (Spain). Women were selected during the immediate postpartum period. The
variables analysed were postpartum depressive symptoms (Edinburgh scale), anxiety
symptoms (STAI state anxiety questionnaire), perceived social support
(Duke-UNC-11), family functioning (family APGAR), self-efficacy in care (Lawton),
sense of coherence (SOC-13), perceived burden (Caregiver Strain Index) and
stressful life events (Holmes and Rahe). The main analysis consisted of a
multiple linear regression. Results: The regression model of depressive symptoms 
found a positive association with perceived burden (β = 0.230, p = 0.015) and
negative associations with self-efficacy in care (β = -0.348, p < 0.001), social 
support (β = -0.161, p < 0.001) and sense of coherence (β = -0.081, p = 0.001).
The regression model of anxiety symptoms obtained a positive association with
perceived burden (β = 1.052, p < 0.001) and negative associations with
self-efficacy in care (β = -0.329, p = 0.041), social support (β = -0.234, p =
0.001) and sense of coherence (β = -0.262, p < 0.001). Discussion: Firstly,
depressive and anxiety symptoms in the puerperium period may be more prevalent
than in other periods of a woman's life. Secondly, perceived social support,
self-efficacy in caring for the newborn and sense of coherence may be protective 
factors for depressive and anxiety symptoms in the puerperium period. Finally,
perceived burden in caring for the newborn may be a risk factor for these
symptoms.

The aim of the present study was to identify and analyze the determinants of
prison inmates' psychosocial quality of life (PQol) as a positive and negative
correlates. Three hundred ninety prison inmates were recruited from the
correctional facilities administered by the Warsaw District Inspectorate of
Prisons. Data were collected by means of the SQLQ, SOC-29, SWS, SPI/TPI, SIPR,
COPE, GSES questionnaires and analyzed by means of SEM. The positive correlates
for prison inmates' PQol are: sense of coherence, self-efficacy, intensity of
religious attitude, social support, and trait curiosity. Among the strategies of 
coping with stress, only seeking social support for emotional reasons is a
significant factor that directly predicts PQol. Substance use and planning play
only a mediating role in PQol prediction. The negative correlate for inmates'
PQol is trait depression. Contrary to predictions, anxiety is not a negative
correlate-as noted above, it is associated with a positive score on PQol.

Supervision is an essential part of the training and work environment of health
professionals, especially of psychotherapists and clinical/health psychologists. 
However, although the supervisory process is always a relational one and may
therefore be influenced by attachment dynamics, the importance of the supervisory
relationship for the professional's performance and the well-being of the
supervisee has yet to be fully examined. In this cross-sectional observational
study, the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-RD; avoidant and
anxious attachment), the Supervisory Relationship Questionnaire (SRQ), the
Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-13) were
analysed for 346 (81.8% female) health professionals. Considering professional
experience and number of supervision sessions as control variables, a better
supervisory relationship negatively predicted burnout symptoms (β = -.31) but
positively predicted sense of coherence (β = .31, both p < .01). The final model,
including avoidant and anxious attachment as additional predictors, explained 30%
of the variance in burnout symptoms and 41% of the variance in sense of
coherence. The results underline the importance of the supervisory relationship
for the well-being and the professional performance of health professionals.
Interactions between the supervisory relationship and underlying attachment
parameters should be further explored in future studies.

BACKGROUND: Sciatica is common and associated with significant impacts for the
individual and society. The SCOPiC randomised controlled trial (RCT) (trial
registration: ISRCTN75449581 ) tested stratified primary care for sciatica by
subgrouping patients into one of three groups based on prognostic and clinical
indicators. Patients in one group were 'fast-tracked' for a magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) scan and spinal specialist opinion. This paper reports qualitative 
research exploring patients' and clinicians' perspectives on the acceptability of
this 'fast-track' pathway.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 patients and 20
clinicians (general practitioners, spinal specialist physiotherapists, spinal
surgeons). Data were analysed thematically and findings explored using
Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) and 'boundary objects' concept.
RESULTS: Whilst the 'fast-track' pathway achieved a degree of 'coherence' (i.e.
made sense) to both patients and clinicians, particularly in relation to
providing early reassurance based on MRI scan findings, it was less 'meaningful' 
to some clinicians for managing patients with acute symptoms, reflecting a
reluctance to move away from the usual 'stepped care' approach. Both groups felt 
a key limitation of the pathway was that it did not shorten patient waiting times
between their spinal specialist consultation and further treatments.
CONCLUSION: Findings contribute new knowledge about patients' and clinicians'
perspectives on the role of imaging and spinal specialist opinion in the
management of sciatica, and provide important insights for understanding the
'fast-track' pathway, as part of the stratified care model tested in the RCT.
Future research into the early referral of patients with sciatica for
investigation and specialist opinion should include strategies to support
clinician behaviour change; as well as take into account the role of imaging in
providing reassurance to patients with severe symptoms in cases where imaging
reveals a clear explanation for the patient's pain, and where this is accompanied
by a thorough explanation from a trusted clinical expert.

Acculturative Stress among Arab Students in Israel: The Roles of Sense of
Coherence and Coping Strategies.

Author information:

Studies, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 8410501, Israel.

BACKGROUND: In Israeli colleges and universities, many Arab students experience
acculturative stress. Such stress arises from the need to learn new cultural
rules, manage the overarching conflict inherent in maintaining elements of their 
culture of origin (i.e., Arab culture) while incorporating elements of the host
culture (i.e., Jewish academic culture), and deal with experiences of prejudice
and discrimination present in the host culture.
METHODS: This study investigated the association between acculturative stress and
depressive symptoms among 170 Arab undergraduates from northern and central
Israel. It also explored the roles of sense of coherence and coping strategies in
the relationship between acculturative stress and depressive symptoms.
Participants completed questionnaires on acculturative stress, depressive
symptoms, sense of coherence, coping strategies, and demographics.
RESULTS: The findings reveal gender differences in the use of different coping
strategies and in levels of depressive symptoms. However, academic-year
differences were found only in levels of sense of coherence and depressive
symptoms. Specifically, female students expressed higher levels of both active
and avoidant coping. Moreover, female students and those in their first and
second years of university studies reported higher levels of depressive symptoms.
Among the male students, acculturative stress was related to depressive symptoms 
indirectly via sense of coherence and active coping. In contrast, among the
female students, acculturative stress was related to depressive symptoms both
directly and indirectly via sense of coherence and avoidant coping. Among first- 
and second-year students, acculturative stress was related to depressive symptoms
indirectly via sense of coherence and avoidant coping. However, among third- and 
fourth-year students, acculturative stress was related to depressive symptoms
both directly and indirectly via sense of coherence.
CONCLUSIONS: This article underscores the significance of gender and
academic-year differences in pathways involving acculturative stress.

PROBLEM: A pathogenic medical orientation focusing on disease management relies
heavily on the skills of healthcare professionals. In contrast, a salutogenic
approach focuses on health promotion by encouraging resource strengthening among 
patients to maintain and support recovery, which could help alleviate healthcare 
burden and enhance healthcare quality. Considering the increased life
expectancies of chronically ill children, this review aimed to consolidate
evidence on the use of salutogenesis among children and adolescents with chronic 
illnesses.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: A scoping review guided by Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage
framework was conducted. Studies with samples of children or adolescents aged
19 years and below with chronic disease were included in the review.
SAMPLE: A library search was performed across six electronic databases (PubMed,
Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Web of Science) from each database's inception to
March 2020. Twelve studies were included.
RESULTS: Current evidence only highlighted the trend and advantages of high sense
of coherence and identify factors that enhance sense of coherence. Boys, younger 
age, higher cognitive functioning, non-migrants, non-smokers, and available peer 
and family support contribute to higher levels of sense of coherence, which lead 
to better perceived health, quality of life, and more positive coping strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals should adopt a salutogenic approach to
encourage patient involvement, independence, and responsibility in maintaining
their own health.
IMPLICATIONS: Further research is needed to provide a holistic view of the sense 
of coherence and application of salutogenesis (especially other salutogenic
concepts) among this sample group, which can also inform future salutogenic
intervention studies.

Purpose: To report the effect of topical bromfenac, a non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), in a case of neovascular age-related macular
degeneration (AMD).
Methods: An 85-year-old woman presented with a complaint of visual acuity
reduction in the right eye. Comprehensive ophthalmological examination and
retinal imaging were performed.
Results: Best corrected visual acuity was 2/100. Fundus examination showed
reticular pseudodrusen and a small hemorrhage in the fovea. Fluorescein
angiography showed an active neovascular membrane. Spectral-domain optical
coherence tomography (SD-OCT) confirmed diagnosis and revealed subretinal and
intraretinal fluid. The patient refused recommended intravitreal anti-vascular
endothelial growth factor treatment and received topical bromfenac 0.09% twice
daily. Follow-up with SD-OCT showed subretinal followed by intraretinal fluid
reduction at 16 weeks after treatment.
Conclusion: Short-term reduction of subretinal and intraretinal fluid was
observed with topical bromfenac monotherapy in neovascular AMD.

OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to investigate the predictive value of
disease-related factors, contextual factors, and functioning on the use of
healthcare for 1 year after stroke.
DESIGN: A prospective study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In total, 219 patients with stroke admitted to a
hospital stroke unit were included.
METHODS: Data were obtained through medical records, structured interviews, and
assessments. Multivariable regression analyses were used to explore the
association between the independent variables (stroke severity, comorbidity, age,
sex, civil status, private financing, sense of coherence, cognitive function,
walking ability, social everyday activities prestroke, and recent fall) and the
use of inpatient or outpatient care 0 to 3, 3 to 6 and 6 to 12 months after
stroke.
RESULTS: Mean age of the participants was 70 years, 43% were women, and 71%
experienced mild stroke severity. All participants received inpatient care at 0
to 3 months, about one-fifth used inpatient care at 3 to 6 or 6 to 12 months, and
all received outpatient care all 3 time periods. Moderate-severe stroke
(P < .001), a lower age (P = .002), and walking disability (P < .001) were
associated with a higher use of inpatient care 0 to 3 months after stroke. Living
alone (P = .025) and recent fall (P = .05) were associated with a higher use of
inpatient care 3 to 6 months after stroke. None of the independent variables were
associated with use of inpatient care 6 to 12 months. Moderate-severe stroke
(0-3; 3-6 months: P < .001, 6-12 months: P = .004), a lower age (0-3 months:
P = .002, 3-6 months: P = .001, 6-12 months: P = .006), and walking disability
(P < .001) were associated with a higher use of outpatient care in all 3 time
periods.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Moderate-severe stroke, lower age, and walking
disability are important predictors of healthcare utilization after stroke. The
findings inform efforts to identify and support people with stroke who have the
potential for high healthcare utilization in the year post stroke.

BACKGROUND: Strong sense of coherence (SOC) has been shown to predict good mental
health among adults whereas its predictive value in adolescence is unclear. This 
life-course oriented prospective study explores whether SOC predicts mental
health in a three-year follow-up.
METHODS: The data is part of the ongoing 'Finnish Family Competence Study'
launched in 1986 in southwestern Finland (baseline n = 1287). The outcome
variable was adolescent's mental health at 18 years of age, measured on the
Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) scale. The main predictor was
Antonovsky's SOC score (1987) measured at the age of 15. A total of 498
adolescents were included in the present analyses. Poisson regression was used by
univariate and multivariable models using the parents' age and socioeconomic
status and adolescents' gender as covariates.
RESULTS: Multivariable analysis showed that a one-unit increase in SOC decreased 
the relative risk of a DAWBA-based diagnosis by 4 % (RR [95% CI] 0.96
[0.94-0.98], p < 0.001).
LIMITATIONS: Typical of very long follow-up, as in our study of nearly two
decades, a substantial proportion of the original population-based cohort was
lost to follow-up weakening the representability of our cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Sense of coherence is a useful and clinically sensitive tool to
predict mental health in adolescence. The easily administered, coping-oriented
SOC questionnaire is an appropriate instrument in screening for adolescents who
would benefit from supportive measures to strengthen their mental well-being.

BACKGROUND: Burnout among residents leads to interruptions in training and even
to exit from programs. Despite the implementation of working hour restrictions in
the U.S. in 2013, the high rate of burnout remains a serious problem. Therefore, 
we analyzed Japanese residents' burnout, training conditions, and associated
factors, especially stress coping ability, which could become an evidence base
for creating guidelines of programs and working environments.
METHODS: In total, 37 teaching hospitals were randomly selected, and all
residents in the third and fifteenth months of a residency program at these
hospitals were targeted for this research. We analyzed the residents' burnout
rates, associated factors, and interactions using response data from a
self-administered questionnaire consisting of the Japanese versions of the
Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Sense of Coherence (SOC) scale, as well
as items asking about their training environments, gender, and age.
RESULTS: Overall, 48 (49.5%) of 97 residents in 18 teaching hospitals (62 and 35 
in the third and fifteenth months, respectively), whose average working hours
were 63.3 h per week, were judged as having burnout, among whom, 33 (53.2%) and
15 (42.9%) had burnout in the third and fifteenth months, respectively. Logistic 
regression analysis indicated that working hours and 10 items on the SOC scale
(SOC10) were significant factors of burnout. Two-way analysis of variance
revealed that working hours was a significant variable for the MBI-emotional
exhaustion score and SOC10 in the third and fifteenth months, respectively.
Regarding the MBI-cynicism and professional efficacy scores, the SOC10 was a
significant variable in both the third and fifteenth months. In addition, the
high SOC group (SOC10 > 45) showed higher personal efficacy under longer working 
hours.
CONCLUSION: About half of the Japanese residents were judged as having burnout as
early as the third month of training under regulations of working 40 h per week. 
Individual stress coping ability and working hours were found to be significant
factors for burnout. Residents with high stress coping ability exhibited more
personal efficacy with more working experiences, which suggests that the SOC
scale could be a valuable tool to help foster a suitable training environment.

OBJECTIVE: To describe how the community from El Faro neighborhood identifies its
community assets, uses them to face life's challenges through the capacity of
collective agency; and by generating community development processes, applying
the salutogenic theory that considers people as active subjects, with the
capacity to conserve and generate health and well-being, through the use of their
own resources called health assets.
METHODS: A map of community assets was made in 2018 in el Faro neighborhood, an
informal settlement of Medellín, Colombia, following the phases recommended by
other authors and from a qualitative, participatory approach that delves into the
health situation of the community.
RESULTS: In this process were identified 12 individual community assets, 12
collective, 13 institutional and 10 in the environment. The main community asset 
among the 47 described was community participation, from the agency capacity,
mainly of its leaders who participating in their own organizations encourage
development, identity construction and well-being.
CONCLUSION: Asset mapping has served to identify intangible assets for the
community and, in turn, this recognition has been useful in strengthening the
agency's capacity for community development. This is a territory transformed by
community reflection processes allowing to understand situations of exclusion and
poverty, seeking to create a more livable place and developing a community
capacity to solve their own problems, through solidarity and community support.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic diseases leave a huge impact on the life of children and
their family caregivers (FCGs). Therefore, the present study was conducted to
determine the effect of the combination of Benson's relaxation technique (BRT)
and brief psycho-educational intervention (BPI) on religious coping (RCOPE),
sense of coherence (SOC), and quality of life (QoL) of FCGs in children with
chronic disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population, consisted of 100 FCGs whose children
were afflicted by chronic diseases, and participated in the current
quasi-experimental pretest posttest design. The children were recruited from two 
state pediatric hospitals in Tehran, Iran. The RCOPE, SOC, and QoL of FCGs were
assessed twice, through pretest (T1) and posttest (T2), four weeks after the
intervention, by means of RCOPE, SOC and SF-36 questionnaires. The FCGs
participated in four training sessions lasting up to 70 min over one week,
followed by four more weeks of training. The Chi-square, Fisher's exact tests,
independent t-test, and paired t-test were performed.
RESULTS: Positive RCOPE had a significant rise at T2 (P = 0.020) compared with
negative RCOPE that did not show significant changes in T2. SOC scores for the
intervention group remarkably rose at T2 (P = 0.022); but, for the control group,
the drop was marginal. The QoL scores of both physical and mental components were
statistically significant in the intervention group at T2 (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Findings of the present study suggest that BRT and BPI can help
significantly improve the RCOPE, SOC, and QoL of families with children suffering
from chronic diseases. Measures that could enhance the RCOPE, SOC, and QoL
include low-cost interventions, good safety, and decent outcome.

Skövde, Sweden.

Objectives: Many women do not reach their own breastfeeding goals regarding
duration of breastfeeding. Different factors influence breastfeeding, and to
learn more about breastfeeding within a multidimensional and longitudinal
perspective, further research is needed. Therefore, the aim of the present study 
was to investigate diverse factors correlated with first-time mothers' enjoyment 
of breastfeeding and breastfeeding duration, between childbirth and two years
after birth.
Methods: In a prospective longitudinal cohort study, 324 newly become mothers
were followed. The Spearman correlation test was used to investigate factors
correlated with the degree to which mothers enjoy breastfeeding and the duration 
of breastfeeding. The Mann-Whitney test was conducted for comparisons of
demographic characteristics between mothers who did or did not breastfeed.
Results: Among the mothers, 99.2% initiated breastfeeding after birth.
Frequencies of breastfeeding were 54.8% at six months, 9.1% at one year, and 1.0%
at two years. The degree to which the mother enjoyed breastfeeding was correlated
positively with (1) the duration of breastfeeding, (2) more positive feelings for
and relation to the child, (3) the partner's perceived relation to the child, (4)
a higher sense of coherence, and (5) stronger perceived parental couple's
relationship. Longer breastfeeding duration was correlated positively with (1) a 
higher degree of enjoyment of breastfeeding, (2) more positive relation to the
child, and (3) stronger perceived parental couple's relationship. Additionally,
breastfeeding during the first two hours after birth, more positive feelings for 
and relation to the child, and a higher degree of enjoyment of breastfeeding were
more frequently reported among breastfeeding mothers, in comparison with not
breastfeeding mothers.
Conclusion: Mothers' subjective experience from breastfeeding, sense of
coherence, and couple relationship with partner and relationship with the child
are valuable factors in regard to breastfeeding.

Bullying is a worldwide problem that has serious effects on the mental health of 
both victims and perpetrators. Although bullying seems related to increasing
globalization and migration, it has seldom been researched in this context. This 
exploratory study examined bullying experiences and related depressive symptoms
among a sample of adolescents with a Turkish migration background in a German
school context (N = 103, 56.7% female, MAge = 16.17, SDAge = 1.36). The study
focuses on three migration-related variables as potentially salutogenic factors: 
Ethnic class composition, acculturation, and religiosity. While the ethnic class 
composition did not show any effect, an integration acculturation strategy and
religiosity proved to be protective factors against bullying experience. The
negative prediction of integration on depressive symptoms was not consistent
throughout the multivariate analyses. The results are discussed against the
background of new impulses for bullying intervention programs for this vulnerable
group of adolescents from a Turkish migration background.

Background: Recent studies have proved the relevance of salutogenetic variables
for fatigue management in breast cancer survivors with cancer-related fatigue
(CRF). This comprehensive cohort design study is the first to examine the impact 
of 2 multimodal therapies, multimodal therapy (MT) and combined therapy (CT),
compared with standard aerobic training (AT) on salutogenetic variables
(self-regulation and internal coherence) and distress in breast cancer survivors 
with CRF. Methods: A total of 105 patients started the therapies and n = 84
completed the Self-regulation Scale, the Internal Coherence Scale, the Cancer
Fatigue Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at baseline, 10
weeks after treatment (T1) and n = 81 after 6 months (T2). Patient satisfaction
and qualitative feedback regarding therapy quality was assessed at T1. A general 
linear model including allocation type, therapy arm (MT/CT/AT), and
bias-adjusting propensity scores tested the superiority of both multimodal
therapies versus AT for all questionnaires at T1 and T2. Results: MT and CT were 
superior to AT to improve self-regulation and patients' satisfaction at T1.
Additionally, CT showed superiority for self-regulation at T2 (all P < .05).
Compared with AT, internal coherence was significantly higher for patients in the
MT arms at T2, respectively (all P < .01). Pearson's correlations between
self-regulation, internal coherence, and CRF improved from baseline to T2 (Mean r
= -0.60). Qualitative feedback confirmed patients' benefits in several
health-related categories. Conclusions: Self-regulation and internal coherence
are manipulable variables with relevant CRF associations. They can be positively 
affected by multimodal therapies. Alongside patients' satisfaction and
qualitative feedback they help refine treatment.

AIM: Aiming at finding an effective way of empowering patients with multiple
sclerosis (MS) to cope with their disease, the objective of the study was to
explore the impact of sense of coherence (SOC) on their health-related quality of
life (HRQoL).
METHODS: A total of 134/150 eligible MS patients followed-up at the Department of
Neurology of the University Medical Centre Maribor, Slovenia, completed
a multiple sclerosis quality of life 54 questionnaire (MSQoL-54) for assessment
of HRQoL, and SOC-13-item questionnaire for assessment of SOC in 2013. Multiple
linear regression was used to analyze the association between the SOC score and
mental and physical subscores of MSQoL-54 adjusted to disease-related and
sociodemographic characteristics as potential confounders.
RESULTS: In a univariate analysis SOC score proved to be the strongest predictor 
of mental subscore of MSQoL-54 (b = 0.834; p < 0.001) explaining 35.6% of its
variance. When adjusted for confounders, it retained its position as the most
important predictor (b = 0.758; p < 0.001). On the other hand, SOC score was a
slightly less important predictor of physical subscore of MSQoL-54, being the
fourth strongest factor (b = 0.582; p < 0.001) in univariate analysis explaining 
19.1% of the variance; however, when adjusted for confounders, its importance
slightly increased by becoming the third most important predictor (b = 0.508;
p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the present study, we can propose SOC as an
important and suitable intervention targeted outcome to consider in managing both
aspects of MS difficulties.

PURPOSE: Severe parental somatic illnesses can influence the entire family,
including adolescents' everyday life, psychosocial functioning and health. Within
salutogenesis, it is highlighted that stressor life events, such as parental
somatic illness, might lead to a chain of events that can produce tension. There 
is a lack of in-depth understanding regarding how adolescents living in a
situation with a severely somatically ill parent (SIP) perceive their own mental 
health. The aim of this study was therefore to explore the lived experience of
Norwegian adolescents living with an SIP, and their perception of the parental
illness' influence on their mental health.
METHODS: Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used. In-depth interviews
were conducted with 11 adolescents (aged 13-18 years) who had an SIP. Two
adolescents with an SIP participated in study preparation and data analysis.
RESULTS: Adolescents perceived parental somatic illness as a multifaceted
influence on their mental health as it represented both personal and relational
strain and growth. Their perceptions can be conceptualized by the super-ordinate 
theme "living in an earthquake zone", and by two themes, "inner shakes-but not
falling apart" and "relational aftershocks-gains and losses".
CONCLUSION: For adolescents, parental somatic illness means personal and
relational strain and growth.

BACKGROUND: Burnout, which includes emotional fatigue, cynicism and low personal 
accomplishment is linked to poor job satisfaction, decreased empathy, job
withdrawal, increased absenteeism and increased medical errors, and is present
among pediatric urologists.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the incidence of burnout among the members of
the French-speaking Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Urology (SFUPA) and
determine which external factors, such as marital or familial status, gender,
age, type of practice or religious belief, impacted burnout rates.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: We sent all members of the French-speaking Society for
Pediatric and Adolescent Urology (SFUPA) an anonymous online questionnaire
containing the validated French version of the 22-item Maslach Burnout Inventory 
- Human Services Survey (MBIHSS). The questionnaire comprised further questions
on age, gender, marital status, presence of children at home, type of practice,
professional status (trainee, consultant, or academic position), spirituality and
whether responders believed they presented signs of burnout.
RESULTS: 70 out of 94 members of the SFUPA answered the questionnaire (response
rate 74%). The number of responders who presented high scores in one, two or the 
three domains of the questionnaire were respectively 48.6% (IC 95%: 36-61%),
21.4% (IC 95%: 12.5-33%) and 8.6% (IC 95%: 3-18%). 34.6% of responders who
believed they presented no signs of burnout actually did have a high burnout
score in at least one domain. There was no significant association between age,
gender, having children or being a trainee and the presence of burnout. However, 
marital status and workplace were significantly associated with presence of signs
of burnout.
DISCUSSION: Burnout is a distinct type of work-related stress - a state of
physical or emotional exhaustion that also involves a sense of reduced
accomplishment and loss of personal identity. In our study the most significant
factor was working in Academic hospitals which can be associated with
administrative workload, long hours and a lack of institutional resources. Being 
in a couple was also associated with less burnout, thus showing the importance of
healthy relationships and sharing on burnout rate. Age, however was not
associated significantly with burnout nor was gender, which is in coherence with 
previous findings.
CONCLUSION: Amongst members of the French-speaking Society of Pediatric and
Adolescent Urology, nearly half presented signs of burnout, especially those
working in academic hospitals. Marital status also influenced burnout rates.
Scientific societies should work on developing tools to identify and accompany
affected individuals.

BACKGROUND: Hospitals, police stations, and fire departments are highly demanding
workplaces. Staff members are regularly exposed to various stressors including
traumatic events. Correspondingly, several studies report high rates of mental
health issues among these occupations. Nevertheless, despite these challenging
circumstances, some staff members manage to sustain their mental health. The
current study is the first to investigate three health-promoting factors
simultaneously among three different, highly demanding occupations.
METHODS: The present cross-sectional survey investigated health-promoting factors
(sense of coherence - SOC, trait-resilience, locus of control - LOC) and mental
health outcomes (general psychopathological symptom burden, posttraumatic stress,
burnout) in medical staff (n = 223), police officers (n = 257), and firefighters 
(n = 100).
RESULTS: Among all occupations, SOC, trait-resilience, and an internal LOC were
negatively associated with general psychopathological symptoms, posttraumatic
stress, and burnout symptoms. By contrast, all these outcome measures were
positively correlated with an external LOC. Multiple regression models including 
all health-promoting factors explained 56% of the variance in general
psychopathological symptoms and 27% in posttraumatic stress symptoms. Among all
occupations, SOC was the strongest predictor of both general psychopathological
symptom burden and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Multigroup path analyses
revealed minor differences across occupations, mainly driven by a stronger
influence of LOC in police officers.
CONCLUSION: Across all occupations, SOC was identified as the most important
health-promoting factor. Future longitudinal studies should further examine the
causal link between health-promoting factors and mental distress in different
workplaces. Such studies will also allow for further development and evaluation
of resilience promoting programs.

Public Health, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany.

Background: Asylum seekers display high prevalence rates of posttraumatic stress 
disorder, depression, anxiety, and panic disorder due to pre-, peri-, and
post-migration stressors. In contrast to the high mental health burden, health
care utilization among asylum seekers in the early phase of resettlement is low. 
However, the early stages after migration are a particularly vulnerable phase in 
which psychosocial support measures are needed to prevent mental disorders from
becoming chronic.
Objective: To identify predictors of asylum seekers' health care utilization in
the early stages of resettlement.
Methods: Using hierarchical logistic regression analysis, the variance
explanation of the (1) general utilization of health care services as well as the
individual utilization of (2) outpatient psychiatrists, (3) counselling centers, 
and (4) general practitioners was analyzed in n = 65 asylum seekers. A structured
interview on health care utilization took place between three to five months
after assessment of possible predictors. We defined the following three groups of
predictors a) the sociodemographic variables gender, age, number of children,
religion, language proficiency, b) the psychological variables sense of coherence
and emotion regulation as well as c) the asylum seekers' psychiatric diagnoses.
Results: Individual sociodemographic factors, such as gender, age, and number of 
children as well as the emotion regulation strategy of expressive suppression and
sense of coherence were shown to be predictive for the utilization of health care
services among asylum seekers.
Conclusions: Low-threshold, culture-sensitive treatment offers for asylum seekers
should be established in the early phase after migration. General practitioners
should be a central hub for further referrals to disorder-specific treatments.

Bacteria utilize chemical and mechanical mechanisms to sense their environment,
to survive hostile conditions. In mechanical sensing, intra-bilayer pressure
profiles change due to deformation induced by the adhesion forces bacteria
experience on a surface. Emergent properties in mono-species Streptococcus mutans
biofilms, such as extracellular matrix production, depend on the adhesion forces 
that streptococci sense. Here we determined whether and how salivary-conditioning
film (SCF) adsorption and the multi-species nature of oral biofilm influence
adhesion force sensing and associated gene expression by S. mutans. Hereto,
Streptococcus oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, and S. mutans were grown together
on different surfaces in the absence and presence of an adsorbed SCF. Atomic
force microscopy and RT-qPCR were used to measure S. mutans adhesion forces and
gene expressions. Upon SCF adsorption, stationary adhesion forces decreased on a 
hydrophobic and increased on a hydrophilic surface to around 8 nN. Optical
coherence tomography showed that triple-species biofilms on SCF-coated surfaces
with dead S. oralis adhered weakly and often detached as a contiguous sheet.
Concurrently, S. mutans displayed no differential adhesion force sensing on
SCF-coated surfaces in the triple-species biofilms with dead S. oralis, but once 
live S. oralis were present S. mutans adhesion force sensing and gene expression 
ranked similar as on surfaces in the absence of an adsorbed SCF. Concluding, live
S. oralis may enzymatically degrade SCF components to facilitate direct contact
of biofilm inhabitants with surfaces and allow S. mutans adhesion force sensing
of underlying surfaces to define its appropriate adaptive response. This
represents a new function of initial colonizers in multi-species oral biofilms.

Longitudinal prediction of positive and negative mental health in Germany,
Russia, and China.

Author information: 
(1)Mental Health Research and Treatment Center, Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Bochum, 
Germany.

The present study examines a broad range of longitudinal predictors of
dimensional positive mental health (PMH) and negative mental health (NMH), using 
data from the BOOM study. Participants were drawn from university student samples
in Germany (1,608), Russia (677) and China (12,057). A structural equation model 
was conducted with four groups of predictors and PMH/NMH as criteria (outcomes). 
Five of the six salutogenic predictors were predictive of both positive mental
health (positively) and negative mental health, as measured by depression
(negatively). Pathogenic predictors anxiety and depression were related to future
depression, but not to positive mental health. Stress at baseline was related to 
both future positive mental health (negatively) and future depression
(positively). Being male in this study was associated with increased future
depression. Results hold across Germany, Russia, and China. Results support the
conceptualization of positive and negative mental health as related, but
independent dimensions across three cultures.

BACKGROUND: Circumpolar nations are experiencing unprecedented environmental and 
public health policy challenges due to global climate change, exploitation of
nonrenewable natural resources, the endangerment of myriad wildlife species, and 
growing sovereignty disputes. In a call to action, the Arctic states' health
ministers recently signed a declaration identifying shared priorities for mutual 
international cooperation. Among agreed-upon collaborations, an enhancement of
intercultural understanding and promotion of culturally appropriate healthcare
delivery systems is to be of high priority going forward.
PURPOSE AND AIM: In far north Canada, health policies perpetuated for generations
upon indigenous communities have, traditionally, often had adverse consequences
for the medically underserved inhabitants of these communities. This discussion
addresses the cultural disconnect between the colonial era and current
indigenous, decolonialist health and healing design strategies.
METHOD AND RESULT: In response, two architectural design case studies are
presented that synthesize ecological site planning precepts with salutogenic
architectural design attributes-a behavioral health and substance abuse
residential treatment center and three elderhousing prototypes for construction
in Canada's Northwest Territories.
CONCLUSION: This conceptual synthesis is practicable, transferable, and adaptable
to varied, extreme climatic conditions, as reflective of best practices in the
delivery of healthcare facilities that express a synthesis of ecohumanist and
salutogenic values and methodologies. The discussion concludes with a call for
empathic, evidence-based collaboration and research that further examines the
blending together of prefabricated off-site construction with on-site
construction approaches.

PURPOSE: Hospital organizational features related to registered nurses' (RNs')
practice environment are often studied using quantitative measures. These are
however unable to capture nuances of experiences of the practice environment from
the perspective of individual RNs. The aim of this study is therefore to
investigate individual RNs' experiences of their work situation in cancer care in
Swedish acute care hospitals.
METHODS: This study is based on a qualitative framework analysis of data derived 
from an open-ended question by 200 RNs working in specialized or general cancer
care hospital units, who responded to the Swedish RN4CAST survey on nurse work
environment. Antonovsky's salutogenic concepts "meaningfulness",
"comprehensibility", and "manageability" were applied post-analysis to support
interpretation of results.
RESULTS: RNs describe a tension between expectations to uphold safe, high quality
care, and working in an environment where they are unable to influence conditions
for care delivery. A lacking sense of agency, on individual and collective
levels, points to organizational factors impeding RNs' use of their competence in
clinical decision-making and in governing practice within their professional
scope.
CONCLUSIONS: RNs in this study appear to experience work situations which, while 
often described as meaningful, generally appear neither comprehensible nor
manageable. The lack of an individual and collective sense of agency found here
could potentially erode RNs' sense of meaningfulness and readiness to invest in
their work.

Sense of coherence and self-efficacy has been found to affect health-related
quality of life in chronic diseases. However, research on respiratory diseases is
limited. Here we report findings on quality of life (QoL) of COPD patients and
the associations with coherence and self-efficacy. This study consists of the
Greek national branch of the UNLOCK study, with a sample of 257 COPD patients.
Coherence and self-efficacy are positively inter-correlated (Pearson rho = 0.590,
p < 0.001). They are negatively correlated with the quality of life (CAT)
[Pearson rho: coherence = -0.29, p < 0.001; self-efficacy = -0.29, p < 0.001) and
mMRC (coherence = -0.37, p < 0.001; self-efficacy rho = -0.32, p < 0.001)].
Coherence is inversely associated with (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive
Lung Disease) GOLD 2018-CAT and GOLD 2018-mMRC classification and "having at
least one exacerbation in the past year". Findings are stressing the need for
their incorporation in primary health care and COPD guidance as it maybe that
enhancing coherence and self-efficacy will improve QoL.

Measuring Global Coherence in People With Aphasia During Unstructured
Conversation.

New York, NY.

Purpose Global coherence is an essential macrolinguistic discourse skill that
speakers use to formulate discourse to convey meaning with maintenance to a
topic. When global coherence is poor, the listener's ability to understand how
the discourse makes sense as a whole is diminished. Measures exist to evaluate
global coherence in people with aphasia during monologue tasks (e.g., picture
description). The aim of the current research is to develop such a measure for
unstructured conversation and to explore how global coherence is impacted by
aphasia during conversation. A global coherence measure for conversation is
required because markedly different cognitive and linguistic demands are made for
production of different types of discourse. Thus, a structured monologue measure 
cannot be used with validity for unstructured conversation. To adequately
evaluate global coherence during conversation, a measure specific to the demands 
of conversation is required. Method We adapted the 4-point Global Coherence Scale
(Wright & Capilouto, 2012; Wright et al., 2013), a monologue-level measure of
global coherence to conversation, resulting in the 4-point Global Coherence Scale
in unstructured conversation (GCSconv). We conducted statistical evaluation of
the reliability/stability of the 4-point GCSconv in 18 unstructured conversations
held by nine people with aphasia. Utterances with low global coherence scores
were classified following a recent methodology to describe how breakdown in these
utterances contributed to diminished global coherence (Hazamy & Obermeyer, 2019).
Results The 4-point GCSconv demonstrated excellent inter/intrarater reliability
and test-retest stability. Nonspecific language and off-topic comments
contributed most frequently to lowered global coherence. Conclusions Findings
suggest the 4-point GCSconv may be a feasible and reliable measure of global
coherence in conversation. This measure adds to a core of emerging reliable
discourse measures for conversation. As such, it has potential to inform
assessment and treatment of everyday conversation and to investigate the
relationship of global coherence in structured monologue and unstructured
conversation. Supplemental Material https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.12469187.

OBJECTIVES: Smartphone use, now a ubiquitous habit among the youth and
psychological stress are interestingly juxtaposed. Sense of coherence (SOC) is
the ability to comprehend a stressful situation and tackle it positively. This
study measured the pattern of smartphone use, perceived stress, SOC and the
inter-relationship between them among undergraduate medical students.
METHODS: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and SOC-13 scales were used to measure
perceived stress and SOC, respectively in 163 medical college students. 'App
Usage', a mobile application was used to objectively record smartphone usage.
RESULTS: Nearly two-thirds (64.4%) were female students. The mean (SD) SOC score 
was 48.7 (11.1) and the mean (SD) PSS score was 20.7 (6.2). SOC was inversely
correlated (r=-0.662, p<0.001) with PSS. The median (IQR) duration of smartphone 
use was 3.4(1.8, 4.8) hours per day which was not significantly correlated with
perceived stress (rho=0.12, p=0.26). Linear regression showed that male students 
used smartphones for a longer duration than females (p=0.0008), after controlling
for confounders.
CONCLUSIONS: Medical college students use smartphones for an average of 3 to 4 h 
a day. Students with a better sense of coherence perceive less stress.
Initiatives to improve the sense of coherence will help increase their resilience
and reduce susceptibility to problematic use of smartphones.

PURPOSE: METHODS:: A 23-gauge-pars plana vitrectomy was performed to remove the
subfoveal silicone oil bubble and to treat the RD. Through a mid-peripheral
retinal tear, we reached the subfoveal space by extending the RD up to the
macular region. We inserted in the subretinal space a Charles cannula protected
with a silicone tip to catch and aspirate the bubble. Intra-operative optical
coherence tomography successfully guided the surgical maneuvers.
RESULTS: We achieved the complete removal of the bubble from the subretinal
space, and this led to the restoration of the retinal morphology with functional 
improvement, although the fovea developed an atrophy.
CONCLUSION: .

Sense of Coherence, Burnout, and Work Engagement: The Moderating Effect of Coping
in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Johannesburg, Johannesburg 2006, South Africa.

Research on coping, sense of coherence, burnout, and work engagement is well
documented in western countries. However, a void of studies exists on how coping 
mechanisms can moderate the relationship among sense of coherence, burnout, and
work engagement in a manufacturing company in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC). The objective of this research was to examine the moderating effect of
coping (COP) in the relationship between sense of coherence (SOC), burnout (BO), 
and work engagement (WE). The study employed a quantitative research approach,
while participants were recruited through convenience sampling. A total of 197
employees (n = 197; females 40%) who are permanently employed in a manufacturing 
organisation in the DRC participated in the study voluntarily. The results
indicate that coping related positively to a sense of coherence. Moreover, the
results indicate that sense of coherence and work engagement related negatively
to burnout. Furthermore, the results show that coping acted as a moderator in the
relationships between variables. The study adds value to the WE theory by
suggesting that an employee who has a high level of COP, high SOC, low level of
BO, will positively engage, perform, and be productive.

Background: Although the default mode network (DMN) is a core network essential
for brain functioning, little is known about its developmental trajectory,
particularly on factors associated with its coherence into a functional network. 
In light of adult studies indicating DMN's susceptibility to stress-related
conditions, we examined links between variability on oxytocin-pathway genes and
DMN connectivity in youth exposed to chronic war-related trauma Methods:
Following a cohort of war-exposed children from early childhood, we imaged the
brains of 74 preadolescents (age 11-13 years; 39 war-exposed) during rest using
magnetoencephalography (MEG). A cumulative risk index on oxytocin-pathway genes
was constructed by combining single nucleotide polymorphisms on five genes
previously linked with social deficits and psychopathology; OXTR rs1042778, OXTR 
rs2254298, OXTRrs53576, CD38 rs3796863, and AVPR1A RS3. Avoidant response to
trauma reminders in early childhood and anxiety disorders in late childhood were 
assessed as predictors of disruptions to DMN theta connectivity. Results: Higher 
vulnerability on oxytocin-pathway genes predicted greater disruptions to DMN
theta connectivity. Avoidant symptoms in early childhood and generalized anxiety 
disorder in later childhood were related to impaired DMN connectivity. In
combination, stress exposure, oxytocin-pathway genes, and stress-related symptoms
explained 24.6% of the variance in DMN connectivity, highlighting the significant
effect of stress on the maturing brain. Conclusions: Findings are the first to
link the oxytocin system and maturation of the DMN, a core system sustaining
autobiographical memories, alteration of intrinsic and extrinsic attention,
mentalization, and sense of self. Results suggest that oxytocin may buffer the
effects of chronic early stress on the DMN, particularly theta rhythms that
typify the developing brain.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have found that sense of coherence (SOC) is
positively related to quality of life (QoL) in persons with chronic conditions.
In congenital heart disease (CHD), the evidence is scant.
AIMS: We investigated (i) intercountry variation in SOC in a large international 
sample of adults with CHD; (ii) the relationship between demographic and clinical
characteristics and SOC; (iii) the relationship between cultural dimensions of
countries and SOC; and (iv) variation in relative importance of SOC in explaining
QoL across the countries.
METHODS: APPROACH-IS was a cross-sectional, observational study, with 4028
patients from 15 countries enrolled. SOC was measured using the 13-item SOC scale
(range 13-91) and QoL was assessed by a linear analog scale (range 0-100).
RESULTS: The mean SOC score was 65.5±13.2. Large intercountry variation was
observed with the strongest SOC in Switzerland (68.8±11.1) and the lowest SOC in 
Japan (59.9±14.5). A lower SOC was associated with a younger age; lower
educational level; with job seeking, being unemployed or disabled; unmarried,
divorced or widowed; from a worse functional class; and simple CHD. Power
distance index and individualism vs collectivism were cultural dimensions
significantly related to SOC. SOC was positively associated with QoL in all
participating countries and in the total sample, with an explained variance
ranging from 5.8% in Argentina to 30.4% in Japan.
CONCLUSION: In adults with CHD, SOC is positively associated with QoL. The
implementation of SOC-enhancing interventions might improve QoL, but strategies
would likely differ across countries given the substantial variation in explained
variance.

Objective: The incidence of skin cancer can be reduced by increasing sun
protective behaviours. Based on the Common-Sense Model and the Intervention
Mapping approach, a brief intervention targeting illness representations about
skin cancer to increase the intention to conduct sun protective behaviours was
developed and evaluated regarding its effectiveness.Design: A randomized pre-post
control group design with 509 healthy participants (69% women, mean age
39 years).Main outcome measures: Changes in illness representations about skin
cancer (emotional representations, illness coherence, and prevention control) and
the intention to conduct sun protective behaviours, i.e. UV protection and sun
avoidance.Results: ANCOVAs showed that the intervention increased illness
coherence and perceived prevention control as well as the intention to conduct
sun protective behaviours. Mediation analyses revealed that the increase in
illness coherence and/or perceived prevention control partially mediated the
effect of the intervention on the increase of the intention to use UV protection 
(indirect effects: .02*, .06*) and to avoid sun exposure (indirect effects:
.01 ns, .04*).Conclusion: The intervention was successful in changing illness
representations and thereby increasing the intention to conduct sun protective
behaviours. The findings provide evidence for the usefulness of the Common-Sense 
Model in the context of illness prevention.

INTRODUCTION: This research aimed to investigate the association between
psychosocial aspects and the impact of oral health on quality of life among
adults.
METHOD: This population-based cross-sectional study was conducted with 1,100
adults aged 20 years or older from a medium-sized city in Rio Grande do Sul,
Southern Brazil. The outcome was Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) in three
categories: better (OHIP=0: 50% of lower scores), moderate (OHIP 1-12.6: 25% of
intermediate scores), and worse (OHIP≥12.7: 25% of higher scores). The exposures 
included measurements of social support, resilience, sense of coherence,
spirituality, quality of life, and stress. We calculated crude and adjusted odds 
ratios and their respective 95% confidence intervals using ordinal logistic
regression.
RESULTS: After adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral
variables, individuals with low social support, low sense of coherence, low
quality of life, and high level of stress were, respectively, 2.16, 2.90, 2.94,
and 1.50 times more likely to report a worse impact of oral health on quality of 
life than those with favorable characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that psychosocial aspects can influence the
perceived impact of oral health on quality of life. Health policies, programs,
and services must recognize the mutual relationship between oral health
indicators and psychosocial aspects among adults.

Publisher: A pesquisa objetivou investigar a associação entre os aspectos
psicossociais e o impacto das condições bucais sobre a qualidade de vida de
adultos, escopo ainda pouco explorado em pesquisas nacionais.Um estudo
transversal de base populacional foi realizado com 1.100 adultos de 20 anos de
idade ou mais, em uma cidade de médio porte do Rio Grande do Sul. O desfecho foi 
avaliado por meio do Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) enquanto as exposições 
incluíram medidas de apoio social, resiliência, senso de coerência,
espiritualidade, qualidade de vida e estresse. Foram calculadas as razões de
chances brutas e ajustadas, bem como seus intervalos de confiança de 95%
utilizando-se regressão logística ordinal.Após o ajuste para variáveis
demográficas, socioeconômicas e comportamentais, indivíduos com baixo apoio
social, baixo senso de coerência, baixa qualidade de vida e alto nível de
estresse possuíam respectivamente 2,16; 2,90; 2,94; 1,50 vezes mais chance de
relatar um pior impacto da condição na qualidade de vida quando comparados aos
indivíduos com estas características favoráveis.Os achados sugerem que os
aspectos psicossociais podem influenciar a avaliação que as pessoas fazem do
impacto da condição bucal sobre a qualidade de vida. É importante que políticas, 
programas e serviços de saúde reconheçam a relação mútua entre os indicadores de 
saúde bucal e os aspectos psicossociais de adultos.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a dialogue-based intervention targeting
psychosocial well-being at 12 months post-stroke.
DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective, randomized, assessor-blinded, controlled trial 
with two parallel groups.
SETTING: Community.
SUBJECTS: Three-hundred and twenty-two adults (⩾18 years) with stroke within the 
last four weeks were randomly allocated into intervention group (n = 166) or
control group (n = 156).
INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group received a dialogue-based intervention to
promote psychosocial well-being, comprising eight individual 1-1½ hour sessions
delivered during the first six months post-stroke.
MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the General Health
Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28). Secondary outcome measures included the Stroke and
Aphasia Quality of Life Scale-39g, the Sense of Coherence scale, and the Yale
Brown single-item questionnaire.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the participants was 66.8 (12.1) years in the
intervention group and 65.7 (13.3) years in the control group. At 12 months
post-stroke, the mean (SE) GHQ-28 score was 20.6 (0.84) in the intervention group
and 19.9 (0.85) in the control group. There were no between-group differences in 
psychosocial well-being at 12 months post-stroke (mean difference: -0.74, 95%
confidence interval (CI): -3.08, 1.60). The secondary outcomes showed no
statistically significant between-group difference in health-related quality of
life, sense of coherence, or depression at 12 months.
CONCLUSION: The results of this trial did not demonstrate lower levels of
emotional distress and anxiety or higher levels of health-related quality of life
in the intervention group (dialogue-based intervention) as compared to the
control group (usual care) at 12 months post-stroke.

Indolent, non-progressive choroidal alterations can be strongly suggestive of
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) but are also rarely of unknown aetiology. A
63-year-old man presented for a routine examination. Comprehensive
ophthalmological examination and retinal imaging was performed. Visual acuity was
20/20. The anterior segment and fundus were unremarkable. Near-infrared
reflectance (NIR) with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography showed
unilateral hyperreflective areas in the left posterior pole, corresponding to
choroidal nodules on enhanced depth imaging and hypofluorescent areas on
indocyanine green angiography. Dermatological evaluation and genetic testing for 
NF1 were negative. Chest computed tomography, liver function, HLA-A29, and
angiotensin-converting enzyme level were negative. The patient has remained in
good health and the choroidal alterations have remained non-progressive for 3
years. Choroidal alterations observed with NIR could be a manifestation of
somatic mosaicism or a variation of a new unclassified correlated condition that 
may be better elucidated in the future, given the use of novel imaging techniques
that are currently available in ophthalmology.

This paper discusses social prescribing as part of the wider NHS England
universal personalised care model, and it describes how community nurses can
engage with social prescribing systems to support community resilience. A case
study based on the example of gardening, as a nature-based social prescription
provided by the RHS Bridgewater Wellbeing Garden, is provided to illustrate the
scope, reach and impact of non-medical, salutogenic approaches for community
practitioners. The authors argue that social prescribing and, in particular,
nature-based solutions, such as gardening, can be used as a non-medical
asset-based approach by all health professionals working in the community as a
way to promote health and wellbeing. They consider how the negative impact of
social distancing resulting from COVID-19 restrictions could be diluted through
collaboration between a holistic, social prescribing system and community staff. 
The paper presents a unique perspective on how community nurses can collaborate
with link workers through social prescribing to help combat social isolation and 
anxiety and support resilience.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the level of acceptance in Singapore of the
eight principles of design underpinning the Environmental Assessment Tool-High
Care (EAT-HC), which is commonly used in Australia to evaluate environments for
the care of people living with dementia. A secondary goal was to identify topics 
particularly relevant to the Singaporean context, which are not included in the
Australian EAT-HC.
BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken in preparation for the development of a
Singaporean version of the Australian EAT-HC.
METHODS: Discussions from 23 focus groups involving 150 family caregivers, aged
care staff, administrators, and architects were recorded and thematically
analyzed to identify the characteristics of the principles underpinning the
EAT-HC that are unlikely to be relevant in a Singaporean version and to identify 
additional topics required to tailor it to reflect the Singaporean culture. The
thematic analysis was supplemented with quantitative data obtained through the
use of simple Likert-type scales measuring the appropriateness of each principle 
in the Singaporean context.
RESULTS: The principles of design that underpin the EAT-HC were highly accepted
by participants and provided a framework for a systematic exploration of
Singaporean residential care for people with dementia. Some topics of particular 
relevance to Singapore were identified. These can be subsumed by the principles
without the need for the principles to be changed.
CONCLUSION: The results support the use of the design principles underpinning the
EAT-HC as the foundation of a tool for the evaluation of Singaporean dementia
facilities.

The aims of the current study were to examine differences between self-changers
(SC) and treatment-changers (TC) in sociodemographic, personal characteristics,
severity of substance use disorders (SUDs), and psychiatric problems, and to
predict the severity of SUDs, psychiatric problems, and belonging to the SC
group. The sample included 229 Israeli respondents (134 SC and 95 TC).
Significant differences between the two groups were found. The SC were younger,
had a higher sense of coherence, and reported more cannabis use. The TC were
involved more in crime and had experienced more child abuse and severe
psychiatric problems compared with the SC. No significant group differences were 
found in the severity of substance dependence. The findings suggested that
severity of SUDs did not differentiate between the groups, but the severity of
psychiatric problems and history of child abuse did. This indicates a need for
treatment interventions targeting all three issues of childhood trauma, SUDs, and
psychiatric problems.

The diagnosis and treatment of medical retinal disease is now inseparable from
retinal imaging in all its multimodal incarnations. The purpose of this article
is to present a selection of very different retinal imaging techniques that are
truly translational, in the sense that they are not only new, but can guide us to
new understandings of disease processes or interventions that are not accessible 
by present methods. Quantitative autofluorescence imaging, now available for
clinical investigation, has already fundamentally changed our understanding of
the role of lipofuscin in age-related macular degeneration. Hyperspectral
autofluorescence imaging is bench science poised not only to unravel the
molecular basis of retinal pigment epithelium fluorescence, but also to be
translated into a clinical camera for earliest detection of age-related macular
degeneration. The ophthalmic endoscope for vitreous surgery is a radically new
retinal imaging system that enables surgical approaches heretofore impossible
while it captures subretinal images of living tissue. Remote retinal imaging
coupled with deep learning artificial intelligence will transform the very fabric
of future medical care.

BACKGROUND: It is important for people with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) to
eat healthily. However, implementing dietary advice in everyday life is
difficult, because eating is not a distinguishable action, but a chain of
activities, embedded in social practices and influenced by previous life
experiences. This research aims to understand why and how eating practices are
developed over the life-course by investigating influential life experiences -
turning points - and coping strategies for eating practices of people with T2DM.
METHODS: The Salutogenic Model of Health guided the study's objective, study
design and analysis. Seventeen interviews were performed and analysed based on
the principles of interpretative phenomenological analysis. Narrative inquiry and
the creation of timelines and food boxes were used as tools to facilitate
reflection on turning points and eating practices.
RESULTS: Turning points for unhealthier eating were experiences that strongly
disturbed the participants' emotional stability. These experiences included
psychosocial trauma, physical health disorders, job loss, and smoking cessation. 
Turning points for healthier eating were experiences that significantly changed
participants views on life and made participants reflective about the effects of 
current eating practices on future health and life goals. These turning points
included confrontation with ill-health, becoming a parent, psychosocial therapy, 
and getting married. Notably, turning points for healthier eating seemed only to 
happen when life was relatively stress-free. All participants experienced turning
points for healthier eating, yet, not all participants succeeded in improving
their diets. Two coping styles were distinguished: active and passive coping.
Active coping individuals were able to act in line with their personal
intentions, whereas passive coping individuals could not. Differences between
active and passive coping styles seemed to be explained by differences in
available resources important for adapting and maintaining a healthy diet.
CONCLUSION: Disadvantaged childhood and later life adversities together with the 
inability to manage the mental stress explained the development unhealthier
eating practices. All participants experienced turning points for healthier
eating that caused eating to become a priority in their life. Yet, the fact that 
not all were able to eat as they intended, advocates for nutritional guidance for
people with T2DM, with a greater emphasis on reflexivity, psycho-social
well-being and social support.

OBJECTIVES: Dementia-friendly communities promote community coherence and reduce 
the risk of ageism in the community. This study examined the effects of a Virtual
Reality (VR) educational program on participants' attitudes towards dementia and 
their sense of community related to supporting community-dwelling older adults.
METHODS: We delivered an educational program using a virtual reality platform
that provided a first-person perspective of people with dementia in the
courtyards of two convenience stores in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, Japan. We
investigated attitudes towards dementia and participants' sense of community
before and after the educational program.
RESULTS: There were 42 study participants (average age = 48 years). The total
scores of attitudes towards dementia and sense of community changed positively
from pre- to postintervention (P = .004 and <.001, respectively).
CONCLUSION: This educational program for understanding dementia could enhance
people's support of community members living with dementia.

Suicide is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with the elderly having the
highest suicide rates. This study tests the effectiveness of a salutogenic model 
in normative elderly people compared with young adults in protecting against risk
behaviors and suicidal tendencies, based on two variables: locus of control and
meaning in life (mediating variable between locus of control and suicidal
tendency). Participants were 191 people aged 65 to 100 years and 200 young adults
aged 18 to 28 years old. Participants completed questionnaires on locus of
control and purpose in life and were assessed for suicidal tendencies. Findings
reveal a negative effect of age on locus of control, purpose in life, and a
negative correlation between purpose in life and internal locus of control and
suicidal tendency. Purpose in life mediates between internal locus of control and
suicidal tendency in both populations. The salutogenic model has significant
implications and can be used to reduce suicidal tendencies.

The promotion of personal and social competencies among students, especially
part-time students, seems more important these days. Actually a strong sense of
coherence and social support may be important resources to manage current
demands. This article shows what can be done by university lecturers to support
students in this critical situation and what can be done by the students
themselves in the sense of self-care.

Some patients' stories can be hard to tell and hard to listen to, especially in
pressured, time-pinched clinical environments. This difficulty, however, doesn't 
absolve clinicians from a duty to try to understand patients' stories, interpret 
their meanings, and respond with care. Such efforts require clinical creativity, 
full engagement, and the recognition that emotions and personal feelings leak
into the space between storyteller and story listener. Art objects are complex
bodies of information that can challenge clinicians and trainees to become more
comfortable with messy narratives as well as with ethical and aesthetic
ambiguity. By slowing down and observing art, trainees can reflect on how
clinicians make sense of stories that contain information that appears random and
lacks coherence-and, more importantly, how clinicians draw on these stories to
respond to patients' needs.

Health, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Kodaira, Japan.

AIMS: The purpose of this study is to retrospectively examine the association
between personal values in adolescence and sense of coherence (SOC) in adulthood.
METHODS: J-SHINE data from wave 1 (2010) and wave 3 (2017) were used in this
study. We retrospectively measured personal values at age 15 in 2017 in two ways:
(a) value priorities developed from Schwartz's theory of basic values; and (b)
the commitment to values measured by Personal Values Questionnaire II (PVQ-II).
Multiple regression analysis was used to estimate the association.
RESULTS: Having a value priority of belief, pursuing one's interest, enduring
active challenges, cherishing family and friends, and having a commitment to
values in adolescence were significantly and positively associated, while
avoiding causing trouble was significantly and negatively associated with SOC in 
adulthood.
CONCLUSIONS: Personal values in adolescence may be associated with SOC in
adulthood. Research of personal values in adolescence could contribute to the
understanding the development of SOC.

People's health assets (HA) mapping process and design dynamization strategies
for it are paramount issues for health promotion. These strategies improve the
health heritage of individuals and communities as both the salutogenic model of
health (SMH) and health assets model (HAM) defend. Connecting and mobilizing HA
and strengthens the 'sense of coherence' (SOC) are both related to enhancing
stress active and effective coping strategies. This study aims to describe the HA
present in a population of certified nursing assistant students (n = 921) in
Spain and then to explore their relationships with the SOC, the motivation to
choose healthcare studies and their academic performance. A great variety of HA
were identified and mapped. Findings showed that individuals with greater
motivation towards self-care and 'caring for others' as internal HA, possessed
higher SOC levels and a strong vocation for healthcare work. Differences in HA
were identified according to gender, age and employment situation. Consistent
connections between the care-relation factor and vocational factor with
interpersonal and extrapersonal HA were reported. Evidence and results
substantiated the salutogenic and asset-based approach as a proper strategy to
strengthen SOC, dynamize their HA map, reinforce the sense of calling and enable 
Certified Nurse Assistant (CNA) students to buffer against caregiving-related
stress and thrive in their profession.

BACKGROUND: Evidence on disease-related quality of life (DRQoL) of patients with 
implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) has been described
heterogeneously. Disease-specific measures of DRQoL in ICD patients are lacking.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to gain a broader understanding of
long-term DRQoL in ICD patients. Special focus was placed on stressors and
cognitive management strategies in everyday life.
METHODS: Data assessment was performed via semistructured, guideline-based
interviews. The monocentric qualitative study included 10 ICD patients with
primary and secondary prophylactic indication and 3 cardiologists. The
qualitative analysis used the salutogenesis model (Antonovsky) as a framework.
RESULTS: The interviews show that most patients do not experience a prominent
limitation in their quality of life through the ICD. We found that patients focus
on their individual coping strategies to handle the ICD indication with a sense
of coherence, aiming at understanding their situation and giving it meaning.
Whether the DRQoL is modified positively or negatively after ICD implantation
depends on individual factors of resilience and factors of coherence.
CONCLUSIONS: We established a salutogenic model for the assessment of DRQoL in
patients with ICDs. A stable DRQoL on ICD implantation and follow-up could be
achieved if patients at high risk (small sense of coherence and reduced
resilience) are identified and their individual lifestyles are taken into
account.

The COVID-19 global crisis is reshaping Canadian society in unexpected and
profound ways. The significantly higher morbidity and mortality risks by age
suggest that this is largely a "gero-pandemic," which has thrust the field of
aging onto center stage. This editorial emphasizes that vulnerable older adults
are also those most affected by COVID-19 in terms of infection risk, negative
health effects, and the potential deleterious outcomes on a range of social,
psychological, and economic contexts - from ageism to social isolation. We also
contend that the pathogenic analysis of this pandemic needs to be balanced with a
salutogenic approach that examines the positive adaptation of people, systems and
society, termed COVID-19 resilience. This begs the question: how and why do some 
older adults and communities adapt and thrive better than others? This
examination will lead to the identification and response to research and data
gaps, challenges, and innovative opportunities as we plan for a future in which
COVID-19 has become another endemic infection in the growing list of emerging and
re-emerging pathogens.

loneliness.

School psychologist have been considered at a high risk for developing work
burnout due to their multiple responsibilities, overload and engagement in caring
for children, families and professionals. In line with the salutogenic approach, 
the aim of the current research was to investigate protective and risk factors to
burnout. Research has indicated that sense of coherence (SOC) may act as a
protective factor. Studies reported that loneliness has been found a risk factor 
that may advance burnout. The current study hypothesized that loneliness may
moderate the link between SOC and burnout. In a sample of 104 Israeli school
psychologists, demographic aspects such as the gender, years of experience, or
type of school in which they work did not predict the burnout, focusing on the
importance of emotional aspects. The analysis demonstrated that the SOC was
negatively associated with burnout among low or mean levels of loneliness, but
not among psychologists with high levels of loneliness. The current study
provides a new insight into the burnout risk, through the focus on personal
resources and social perceptions. Implications for theoretical and practices are 
further discussed.

BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, which nowadays 
has exceeded 2.5 million notified infections in the world and about 200,000
deaths, is a strong reminder that urbanization has changed the way that people
and communities live, work, and interact, and it's necessary to make resilient
the systems and local capacities to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
How we can re-design the concept of Public Health in relation to the built
environment and the contemporary cities?
METHODS: According to the previous statements and scenario, aim of this paper is 
to integrate the Urban Health strategic objectives, focusing the possible
responses, both immediate and medium-long term, to the current environmental,
social, and economic aspects of the "period" of physical distancing.  Results.
Immediate Actions are 01. program the flexibility of city schedules; 02. plan a
smart and sustainable mobility network; 03. define a neighborhood services' plan;
04. develop a digitization of the urban context, promoting the smart communities;
05. re-think the accessibility to the places of culture and tourism.  Medium-long
term Actions are 06. design the indoor flexibility of domestic living spaces; 07.
re-think building typologies, fostering the presence of semi-private or
collective spaces; 08. renovate the basic care services' network; 09. integrate
the existing environmental emergency plans, with those related to the health
emergencies; 10. improve stakeholders' awareness of the factors affecting Public 
Health in the cities.
CONCLUSIONS: The Decalogue of Public Health opportunities may provide a useful
basis for Designers (Architects and Urban Planners), Policy Makers, Public Health
experts and Local Health Agencies, in promoting actions and policies aimed to
transform our cities in healthier and Salutogenic living environments.

Objectives: The common sense model provides a theoretical framework for
understanding substantial fatigue among (haematological) cancer survivors based
on their illness perceptions. We therefore examined the associations between
modifiable illness perceptions and substantial fatigue while controlling for
sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological factors (symptoms of depression and
anxiety) among haematological cancer survivors.Methods: Data from the
population-based PROFILES registry were used. Survivors diagnosed between 1999
and 2013 with Hodgkin lymphoma (N = 164), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (N = 655) and
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (N = 174) were included. Survivors completed the
Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ), the Fatigue Assessment Scale
(FAS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Multivariable logistic
regressions analyses were performed for the total group and three haematological 
cancers separately relating illness perceptions to substantial fatigue (>21
FAS).Results: Haematological cancer survivors with illness perceptions that
represent more negative consequences (consequences, OR = 1.27; 95%CI =
1.13-1.42); attribute more symptoms to their illness (identity, OR = 1.29; 95%CI 
= 1.17-1.43); and have a poorer illness understanding (coherence, 1.13;
1.04-1.22) were more often substantially fatigued. For the remaining five illness
perceptions, no significant association was found. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma survivors
who reported a poor illness understanding (coherence, OR = 1.35; 95% CI =
1.06-1.72) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia survivors who reported that
treatment can control (OR = 1.25; 95%CI = 1.01-1.55) the illness experienced more
often substantial fatigue.Conclusion: Those who experience more consequences of
their disease, attribute more symptoms to their illness, and have a poorer
illness understanding, have a higher risk to experience substantial levels of
fatigue even years after diagnosis. Psychological interventions changing these
illness perceptions may be beneficial in reducing fatigue among haematological
cancer survivors.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the association between sense 
of coherence (SOC) and all-cause mortality in the general adult population.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort
studies. We searched eight electronic bibliographic databases for eligible
studies. A random effects model and the restricted maximum likelihood method were
used to calculate the pooled effect size.
RESULTS: Eight studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. The studies included 
48,138 participants, of whom 5307 died during a median follow-up of 14.1 years
(range, 8-29.5 years). Their age ranged from 20 to 80 years, and 53% of them were
men. In the meta-analysis model of crude values, the risk of all-cause mortality 
for individuals with a weak SOC (lowest tertile) was 1.30 (95% confidence
interval [CI] = 1.09-1.55, p = .003, I = 78.84%) compared with individuals with a
strong SOC (highest tertile). In the model adjusted for age, the risk remained
almost the same (risk ratio = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.15-1.38, p < .001, I = 69.59%). In
the model adjusted for several other risk factors for mortality, the risk was
still 1.17 (95% CI = 1.07-1.27, p < .001, I = 57.85%).
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that a weak SOC is associated with an
increased risk of all-cause mortality in the general adult population. Future
studies are needed to further develop assessment tools for SOC with good
psychometric properties and to determine the disease processes that mediate the
association of SOC with mortality.

(1) Background: We evaluated macular ganglion cell layer-inner plexiform layer
(GCL-IPL) thickness in patients with primary macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal
detachment (RRD) treated with scleral buckling (SB) or pars plana vitrectomy
(PPV) using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). (2) Methods:
In this retrospective, observational study, we reviewed the medical records of
patients undergoing SB or PPV surgery for macula-off RRD. SD-OCT was performed at
three and 12 months after surgery. The central and parafoveal GCL-IPL thicknesses
in treated eyes were compared with those of healthy fellow eyes. OCT measurements
between the SB and PPV group were also compared using the analysis of covariance.
(3) Results: Seventy-one eyes of 71 patients with a mean age of 61.2 ± 11.7 years
were included. The parafoveal GCL-IPL thickness of the PPV group was
significantly reduced, with respect to fellow eyes, at three and 12 months (p <
0.01). After adjusting for age, axial length, spherical equivalent, RD extent,
preoperative intraretinal cysts, duration of symptoms and postoperative IOP, the 
parafoveal GCL-IPL thickness in the PPV group was significantly reduced with
respect to the SB group, both at three and 12 months (F = 11.45, p = 0.001 and F 
= 12.37, p = 0.001, respectively). (4) Conclusions: In conclusion, the GCL-IPL is
reduced in thickness in eyes with macula-off RRD treated with vitrectomy and is
significantly thinner compared to eyes undergoing scleral buckling surgery.

There is a growing body of evidence that points to an important role for
modification of lifestyle factors and promotion of health-related quality of life
in the secondary prevention of disease progression in multiple sclerosis
(D'Hooghe et al., 2010; Weiland et al., 2014; Hadgkiss et al., 2015). As a
clinical psychologist diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2012 I have gained a
unique insight into ways in which people living with MS and clinicians can
usefully integrate evidence-based lifestyle modifications that enhance
self-efficacy and self-management to improve wider psychological and physical
health. The framework presented here enables clinicians to engage in salutogenic 
health promotion by placing value upon the importance of healthy, evidence-based 
behavior change. Furthermore, the framework provides a structure which can
empower and provide guidance for people living with MS on what and how to
implement and sustain behavior change and emotional wellbeing in the face of this
life-changing diagnosis.

Cells navigating through complex tissues face a fundamental challenge: while
multiple protrusions explore different paths, the cell needs to avoid
entanglement. How a cell surveys and then corrects its own shape is poorly
understood. Here, we demonstrate that spatially distinct microtubule dynamics
regulate amoeboid cell migration by locally promoting the retraction of
protrusions. In migrating dendritic cells, local microtubule depolymerization
within protrusions remote from the microtubule organizing center triggers
actomyosin contractility controlled by RhoA and its exchange factor Lfc.
Depletion of Lfc leads to aberrant myosin localization, thereby causing two
effects that rate-limit locomotion: (1) impaired cell edge coordination during
path finding and (2) defective adhesion resolution. Compromised shape control is 
particularly hindering in geometrically complex microenvironments, where it leads
to entanglement and ultimately fragmentation of the cell body. We thus
demonstrate that microtubules can act as a proprioceptive device: they sense cell
shape and control actomyosin retraction to sustain cellular coherence.

The traditional approach in neuroscience relies on encoding models where brain
responses are related to different stimuli in order to establish dependencies. In
decoding tasks, on the contrary, brain responses are used to predict the stimuli,
and traditionally, the signals are assumed stationary within trials, which is
rarely the case for natural stimuli. We hypothesize that a decoding model
assuming each experimental trial as a realization of a random process more likely
reflects the statistical properties of the undergoing process compared to the
assumption of stationarity. Here, we propose a Coherence-based spectro-spatial
filter that allows for reconstructing stimulus features from brain signal's
features. The proposed method extracts common patterns between features of the
brain signals and the stimuli that produced them. These patterns, originating
from different recording electrodes are combined, forming a spatial filter that
produces a unified prediction of the presented stimulus. This approach takes into
account frequency, phase, and spatial distribution of brain features, hence
avoiding the need to predefine specific frequency bands of interest or phase
relationships between stimulus and brain responses manually. Furthermore, the
model does not require the tuning of hyper-parameters, reducing significantly the
computational load attached to it. Using three different cognitive tasks (motor
movements, speech perception, and speech production), we show that the proposed
method consistently improves stimulus feature predictions in terms of correlation
(group averages of 0.74 for motor movements, 0.84 for speech perception, and 0.74
for speech production) in comparison with other methods based on regularized
multivariate regression, probabilistic graphical models and artificial neural
networks. Furthermore, the model parameters revealed those anatomical regions and
spectral components that were discriminant in the different cognitive tasks. This
novel method does not only provide a useful tool to address fundamental
neuroscience questions, but could also be applied to neuroprosthetics.

BACKGROUND: Little information is available on the relationship between mothers' 
psychosocial profile and caries status, and less information is available on the 
oral health status and psychosocial status of mothers of young children in
Africa. This study examined the association between the psychosocial profile of
mothers in Nigeria and their prevalence of caries.
METHODS: The prevalence of caries and severe caries (DMFT > 3) in mothers with
children 71 months old and younger recruited through a household survey in
Ile-Ife, Nigeria, was estimated through clinical examination. The explanatory
variables were maternal education, income, decision-making status, and
psychosocial status (dental anxiety, general anxiety, depressive symptoms,
parenting stress, executive dysfunction, sense of coherence, fatalism and social 
support). The risk indicators for maternal caries were analyzed with logistic
regression.
RESULTS: The prevalence of caries was 3.3%. Twenty (39.2%) of the 51 women with
caries had DMFT > 3. Most study participants were 25-34 years old (59.3%), had
secondary level education (63.1%), earned N18,000 ($49)-N30000 ($84) per month
(42.9%), and can make autonomous decisions about their health care, household
purchases, or visits to family/relatives (68.8%). Most women had normal general
anxiety (79.9%), low dental anxiety (90.4%), and normal stress (76.4%) levels.
Most also had high fatalism (56.6%), perceived moderate social support (81.6%),
had normal depressive symptoms (75.9%), low executive dysfunction (55.9%), and
high sense of coherence (53.8%). Mothers who had clinically significant levels of
stress were twice more likely to have caries than were those whose level of
stress was normal (AOR: 2.26; 95%CI: 1.04-4.89; P = 0.039). Also, mothers who had
high fatalism were less likely to have caries than were those with low fatalism
(AOR: 0.40; 95%CI: 0.21-0.75; P = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: High levels of parenting stress was a risk indicator for caries while
high fatalism was protective from caries in mothers of children younger than
6-years. Maternal education, income and decision-making ability were not
associated with maternal caries. Though the caries prevalence for women with
young children was low, the prevalence of severe caries was high and this because
of the possible negative effect on their health and wellbeing.

Exploring Factors That Helped Adolescents Adjust and Continue With Life After the
Death of a Parent.

(1)Department of Psychology, Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch, South Africa.

The aim of this study was to explore factors that helped adolescents to adjust
and continue with life after the death of a parent. A qualitative research design
was utilized, in which 12 participants participated in semistructured interviews.
Data were analyzed according to thematic analysis. The following categories and
themes emerged from the data: family support-supportive remaining parent, parent 
has a supportive partner and supportive extended family; social support-child has
supportive friends and supportive community; religion--religion as a coping
mechanism and religion as means of communicating with the deceased parent; and a 
strong personal sense of coherence (the ability to relate to and make sense of
the world) as an intrapersonal coping mechanism. In addition, the following
themes also emerged: exercising, allowing time to prepare for the death of a
terminally ill parent, tangible reminders of the deceased, and journal writing.
The findings can be used to design interventions for adolescents whose parent has
passed away.

Individuals who experience difficulty constructing coherent narratives about
significant personal experiences generally report less psychological well-being
and more depressive symptoms. It remains, however, unclear whether a negative
emotional state, one of the core symptoms of depression, causes this impairment
in autobiographical memory coherence. The current study aimed to examine the
causal relation between mood and memory coherence by means of a mood induction
paradigm. A group of 165 students were randomly allocated to one of three mood
groups: negative, positive, and neutral. We hypothesized that memory coherence
would decrease following a negative mood induction. In addition, working memory
capacity was expected to mediate the association between mood and memory
coherence. Contrary to predictions, memory coherence increased following a
negative mood induction. This increase was likewise observed in the positive mood
group, though memory coherence remained consistent in the neutral mood group.
This effect of mood on memory coherence was solely observed in female
participants and not in the small male subsample. Results provided no support for
the hypothesis that working memory capacity functioned as an underlying
mechanism. Different theoretical explanations are discussed.

OBJECTIVES: We examined longitudinal associations between late-life personality
traits and cognitive impairment, dementia, and mortality in the population-based 
Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia (CAIDE) Study.
METHODS: Anger expression and trait anger (State-Trait Anger Expression
Inventory), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), and sense of coherence
(Sense of Coherence Scale) were assessed at the 1998 CAIDE visit (1266
cognitively normal individuals, mean age 71.0 years). Totally, 582 participants
had complete re-examination in 2005-2008 (105 mild cognitive impairment, MCI; and
29 dementia). National registers data until 2008 were also used for both
participants and nonparticipants to ascertain incident dementia (96 cases) and
mortality (227 died). Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, education, follow-up
time, cardiovascular and lifestyle factors, and depressive symptoms.
RESULTS: Higher anxiety was associated with higher risk of MCI/dementia (OR 1.68,
95% CI 1.07-2.63) and death (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.08-1.98). High sense of coherence 
was associated with lower mortality (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45-0.93). These
associations were attenuated after accounting for depressive symptoms (OR 1.57,
95% CI 0.96-2.58 for anxiety-MCI/dementia; HR 1.35, 95% CI 0.97-1.86 for
anxiety-mortality; and HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.45-1.04 for sense of
coherence-mortality). Trait anger was associated with higher dementia risk even
after adjustments (HR 1.90, 95% CI 1.14-3.18).
CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety was linked to worse cognitive outcome and mortality and
sense of coherence to lower mortality. Depressive symptoms attenuated the
associations. As a novel finding, trait anger was connected to dementia risk.
These findings emphasize the importance of personality-related risk factors for
dementia and mortality. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:-, 2020.

Objective: To study the long-term effects of weight reduction, quality of life
and sense of coherence in a primary health care (PHC)-based programme with two
different intensities.Design: Prospective two-armed randomised
intervention.Setting: Three PHC centres in south west of Sweden.Subjects: In
total, 289 women and men aged 40-65 years with a BMI of 28-35 were recruited for 
a two-year weight-reduction programme. Participants were randomized to
high-intensity or low-intensity groups. Blood samples, physical measurements and 
questionnaires were analysed. Participants received cookbooks and dietary
lectures. The high-intensity group also received Motivational interviewing (MI), 
dietary advice on prescription (DAP- advice), a grocery store lecture, a website 
and weekly e-mails.Main outcome measures: Weight, quality of life, risks and
health factors.Results: In total, 182 (64%) participants completed the 2-year
follow-up. The total sample reduced their weight by 1 kg (p = 0.006). No
significant differences regarding weight were found between the groups.
Anxiety/depression decreased in EQ5-D (p = 0.021), EQ5-D VAS (p = 0.002) and SOC 
(p = 0.042). Between the groups, there were significant differences in EQ5-D
usual activities (p = 0.004), anxiety/depression (p = 0.013), pain/discomfort (p 
= 0.041), fruit and vegetables (p = 0.005), HLV anxiety (p = 0.005), and visits
to nurses (p = 0.012).Conclusion: The total population lost weight, and the
high-intensity and low-intensity programmes did not result in significant
differences in terms of weight. The high-intensity programme reported health
benefits linked to lower levels of anxiety and depression, increased activity and
intake of greens and reduced visits to physicians and nurses.Key pointsBoth
groups had a consisting weight- reduction after two years.High intensity did not 
lead to a significant difference in weight reduction between the groups.The
high-intensity group reported more health effects, such as better quality of
life, reduced anxiety, and increased greenery intake. It is unknown how much
support patients in a weight- reduction programme in PHC require to succeed with 
weight loss and a healthy lifestyle.

Comment on
    Integr Psychol Behav Sci. 2020 Sep;54(3):521-562.

The analysis and proposal of Zagaria, Andò and Zennaro are suggestive, but the
essential question is not raised: the need for scientific research to be
explicitly based on an epistemological reflection that takes into account the
specificity of psychology. In the first and second parts of my comment, I will
justify the need for epistemological reflection in psychology, and in the third
part, I will analyze, by means of an example, why the option of adopting the
principles of evolutionary psychology does not guarantee greater theoretical
coherence.

This study investigated the associations between sex, age, socio-economic status,
stress, sense of coherence (SOC), and health (mental wellbeing, depressive
symptoms, self-rated health, and subjective health complaints) in Norwegian
adolescents aged 13-19 years. Furthermore, the study investigated the potential
protective or compensatory role from SOC on the association between stress and
health. Methods: The study was based on a cross-sectional sample of 1233
adolescents. Data were analyzed with descriptive, comparative, and multiple
linear regression analyses. Results: Girls reported significantly higher scores
on depressive symptoms and subjective health complaints than boys. Stress was
significantly and positively associated with depressive symptoms. SOC associated 
significantly with all outcome variables; and especially with mental wellbeing
and depressive symptoms. Significant interaction effects of sex in combination
with stress and SOC were found in association with depression and mental
wellbeing. Associations were strongest for girls. Conclusion: The findings
provided support for the significant role of SOC as a coping resource, especially
in relation to adolescents' mental health; weaker associations were found with
subjective health complains and self-rated health. The findings also mainly
supported a compensatory role of SOC on the association between stress and health
during adolescence.

Psychological Resilience of Volunteers in a South African Health Care Context: A 
Salutogenic Approach and Hermeneutic Phenomenological Inquiry.

Volunteering in non-Western countries, such as South Africa, is subject to poor
infrastructure, lack of resources, poverty-stricken conditions and often
conducted by volunteers from lower socio-economic spheres of society. Sustaining 
the well-being of volunteers in this context is essential in ensuring their
continued capacity to volunteer. To do so, it is important to understand the
psychological resilience of these volunteers and the resistance resources they
employ to positively adapt to their challenging work-life circumstances. The aim 
of this qualitative hermeneutic phenomenological study was to explore volunteers'
psychological resilience from a salutogenic perspective. In-depth interviews were
conducted with eight volunteers servicing government-run hospitals. Data were
analysed through phenomenological hermeneutical analysis. Findings show a
characteristic work-life orientation to be at the root of volunteers' resilience.
Their work-life orientation is based on a distinct inner drive, an
other-directedness and a "calling" work orientation. It is proposed that this
work-life orientation enables volunteers in this study context, to cope with and 
positively adapt to challenging work-life circumstances and continue
volunteering. The elements of their work-life orientation are presented as
intrapersonal strength resources fundamental to their psychological resilience.
It is suggested that organisations invest in developmental interventions that
endorse and promote these intrapersonal strengths.

rehabilitation.

Sense of coherence (SOC) constitutes the key component of salutogenesis theory.
It reflects individuals' confidence that their environment is comprehensible and 
manageable and that their lives are meaningful. Research demonstrates a strong
cross-sectional relationship between SOC and mental health. However, little is
known about SOC's temporal stability and its potential to predict changes in
psychopathological symptom severity in different settings. The goal of the
current study was to address this gap. The sample of the two-wave longitudinal
study consists of 294 patients receiving inpatient psychotherapeutic (and
psychopharmacological) treatment for various psychological disorders at a German 
psychosomatic rehabilitation clinic. SOC (Antonovsky, Social Science & Medicine, 
1993, 36, 725-733) and outcome measures (i.e., general mental health problems,
depression and anxiety symptoms) were assessed within two days of arrival and at 
the end of rehabilitation (week 5/6). SOC was significantly enhanced after
treatment whereas psychopathological symptoms were significantly reduced.
Regression analyses revealed that pre-treatment SOC was a significant negative
predictor of post-treatment symptom severity for all outcome measures even after 
controlling for pre-treatment symptoms. The current findings provide first
evidence that SOC is a significant unique predictor of symptom change. Future
studies need to further investigate longitudinal associations between SOC and
mental health outcomes in different settings.

Stockholm, Sweden.

OBJECTIVE: Women's levels of resilience and attitudes towards perineal
lacerations vary greatly. Some women see them as part of the birthing process,
while others react with anger, depressed mood or even thoughts of self-harm. A
previous study has reported increased risk of postpartum depressive (PPD)
symptoms in women with severe perineal lacerations. The aim of this study was to 
assess the association between severe obstetric perineal lacerations and PPD. A
secondary objective was to assess this association among women with low
resilience.
DESIGN: Nested cohort study.
SETTING: Uppsala, Sweden.
SAMPLE: Vaginally delivered women with singleton pregnancies (n = 2990).
METHODS: The main exposure was obstetric perineal lacerations. Resilience was
assessed in gestational week 32 using the Swedish version of the Sense of
Coherence Scale. A digital acyclic graph was used to identify possible
confounders and mediators. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds
ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). A sub-analysis was run after
excluding women with normal or high resilience.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postpartum depression, assessed with the Depression
Self-Reporting Scale, completed at 6 weeks postpartum.
RESULTS: There was no significant association between severe obstetric perineal
lacerations and PPD at 6 weeks postpartum. However, a significant association was
found between severe lacerations and PPD in women with low resilience (OR = 4.8, 
95% CI 1.2-20), persisting even after adjusting for confounding factors.
CONCLUSION: Healthcare professionals might need to identify women with low
resilience, as they are at increased risk for PPD after a severe perineal
laceration.
TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Severe perineal lacerations associated with postpartum
depression in women with low resilience in a Swedish cohort.

Determinants of oral-health related quality of life and overall quality of life
among early adolescents with type-1 diabetes.

Elheeny AAH(1).

Author information: 
(1)Lecturer of Paediatric and Community Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Minia
University.

OBJECTIVE: To identify determinants of oral health-quality of life (OHRQoL) and
its association with overall quality of life (QoL).
BASIC RESEARCH DESIGN: Cross-sectional analytic study. Predictors variables were 
selected based on Wilson and Cleary's model for patient outcomes including
individual factors and socioeconomic status (SES) to represent environmental and 
clinical/biological factors.
PARTICIPANTS: 444 children aged 11 to 14 years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: OHRQoL and overall QoL. Data were analysed using
univariate correlation coefficients and structural equation modelling. The
initial path was analysed for the goodness-of-fit. The level of significance
adjusted at 5% and 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS: In the final model, sense of coherence (SOC) and dental coping behaviour
displayed direct and indirect effects on OHRQoL and QoL. Gingival condition and
metabolic disease control displayed bidirectional effects on overall QoL. SES was
directly and indirectly associated with OHRQoL. The fit of final model indicators
was CFI = 0.99, GFI = 0.99. AGFI = 0.68, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA =0.03, χ² = 13.25, and
χ²/d.f. ratio = 1.43 (p ⟩ 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing the SOC and SE of early adolescents with T1DM may improve 
their oral-health related quality of life and overall quality of life.

A 'near-life experience': lived experiences of spirituality from the perspective 
of people who have been subject to inpatient psychiatric care.

AIMS: To describe lived experiences of spirituality from the perspective of
people who have been subject to inpatient psychiatric care and to interpret these
experiences from an understanding of health as dialectical.
METHODS: After approval from a regional ethical board, eleven participants were
recruited from two organisations for people with mental health problems.
Participants were asked to narrate about spiritual experiences and occasions
where such experiences had come close. The transcribed interviews were analysed
by means of a phenomenological hermeneutical approach.
FINDINGS: A structural analysis of the text resulted in three themes; perceiving 
the presence of something extra mundane, making sense of reality and struggling
for acceptance. The comprehensive understanding highlights spiritual experiences 
as going beyond religion, even though religious experiences appear as part of it.
These experiences can indeed be a resource contributing to experiences of hope,
connectedness, meaning and coherence in life. However, they can also give rise to
doubt, anxiety and feelings of loneliness and hopelessness. Rather than
understanding spiritual experiences as being either 'good' or 'bad', we could
approach spirituality as something that is always present in alternate and
inter-related forms. Metaphorically, this could be understood as a 'near-life
experience', summarising participants' experiences related to their struggle with
issues related to suffering and health which are simultaneously present.
CONCLUSIONS: If psychiatric nurses could approach this complexity and, without
being judgemental, explore seemingly positive and negative experiences of
spirituality as dialectically related to each other, rather than viewing them as 
either resources or problems, this could contribute to insiderness care and
hopefully also support people who struggle with these experiences to seek help
when needed.

BACKGROUND: Although midwifery care is wellness-based and promotes normal
physiology, it exists within a medical model that focuses on risk aversion and
disease prevention. Salutogenic theory could provide an alternative approach to
midwifery care, supporting health-promoting factors, rather than solely avoiding 
adverse events.
AIMS: The aim of this study was to explore women's experiences of their midwifery
care and identify salutogenic aspects of midwifery care.
METHODS: Best-fit framework synthesis was used to analyse 349 quotes about
women's experiences of midwifery care from 31 qualitative studies in ten
high-income countries. Key salutogenic concepts of comprehensibility,
manageability and meaningfulness were used as the basis for coding, and thematic 
analysis was used to expand and clarify the framework to best fit the data.
FINDINGS: Definitions for the salutogenic aspects of midwifery care were
developed. Comprehensibility (cognitive aspects of health): ways that midwives
help women increase predictability and preparation during childbearing through
apredictable caregiver, a predictable system and preparation for an unpredictable
experience. Manageability (behavioural aspects of health): ways that midwives
enhance and support a woman's internal resilience, adding extra support when
needed, and strengthen women's external resources through connections to family, 
community and specialist care. Meaningfulness (emotional/spiritual aspects of
health): ways that midwives encourage the commitment and engagement of
childbearing women by providing care through a personalised relationship, by
cultivating a woman's autonomy.
CONCLUSION: Findings of this study may be used to further research into ways that
salutogenic theory can bring a health and wellness-focused agenda to midwifery
policy and practice.

Contemporary workplaces are influenced by rapid changes, high levels of
competition, increasing complexities and internationalisation processes. At the
edge of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), insecurities and anxieties are
high, and leaders are encouraged more than ever to lead employees with meaningful
vision and prudence in order to make use of employees' strengths, and ensure
mental health and well-being. The aim of this article is to present new insights 
into salutogenesis, particularly sense of coherence (SOC), compassionate love
(CL), and coping (C) in leaders with different cultural backgrounds. This study
strengthens the idea that CL is a coping mechanism. This coping mechanism can be 
used by leaders to establish a resilient and salutogenic organisations. This
article explores the subjective perspectives of 22 international leaders from
five different countries and their views regarding SOC, CL and C through a
qualitative research approach, using a qualitative online questionnaire for data 
collection and content analysis for data analysis. The findings on the
perspectives of leaders provide new and original insights into how SOC, CL and C 
are connected, and how these concepts contribute to healthy organisations which
are on their way to the transition into the 4IR. Conclusions are drawn.
Recommendations for future research and practice are given.

Coping with the loss of a child is a challenging and difficult experience that
disrupts the lives of the surviving parents and the fabric of the family. Our
goal is to identify the factors that help bereaved parents cope with this loss
and introduce hope and future perspectives into their lives. Our sample consisted
of 81 parents (30 fathers and 51 mothers), who completed questionnaires on the
following topics: family climate, loneliness, sense of coherence and hope. In
addition, interviews were conducted with six parents to further clarify the
quantitative results. A moderated mediation model revealed that increased levels 
of loneliness among the parents predicted lower levels of hope. However, their
emotional resources in terms of their sense of coherence mediated this
relationship. In addition, the number of years since the loss moderated the
negative relationship between loneliness and the parents' emotional resources. It
can be concluded that the negative impact of loneliness on parents' sense of
coherence declined over time. The interviews conducted extend the understanding
of these results, as parents described their ability to continue with their lives
and identified their goals in terms of the hope theory, alongside their ongoing
pain. Finally, the therapeutic implications of the results we obtained are
discussed.

PURPOSE: Myopic foveoschisis (MF) is characterized by the splitting of the
retinal layers in the fovea of patients with high myopia (HM). MF may progress
into foveal detachment or macular hole formation with consequent loss of central 
vision. The aim of this study is to investigate morphological and functional
changes of the macular region in myopic subjects with and without foveoschisis.
DESIGN: Observational, cross-sectional, comparative study.
METHODS: Forty-eight patients with HM and 24 healthy controls were evaluated by
spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), multifocal
electroretinography (mfERG) and microperimetry (MP-1) tests to assess macular
thickness, functionality and sensitivity values, respectively. The results of the
diagnostic examinations were compared between three groups: HM patients with MF
(N = 24), HM patients without MF (N = 24) and control group (CG) (N = 24). All
statistical analyses were performed with STATA 14.0 (Collage Station, Texas,
USA). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post hoc test was 
used to analyze differences between groups unless specified; p values < 0.05 were
considered as statistically significant. Gender distribution was compared by the 
Chi square test.
RESULTS: The statistical analysis with one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc
test showed a significant increase in macular thickness in HM patients with MF
when compared to both HM patients without MF and CG. Morphological changes were
associated with functional impairment as demonstrated by the significant decrease
in amplitude of the P1 wave and MP-1 sensitivity (p < 0.05), according to the
anatomical landmarks.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the morphological changes observed in the
central retina of HM patients with MF are associated with functional alterations.
High-tech diagnostic tests such as SD-OCT, mfERG and MP-1 could be useful for
management in complications of MF.

What matters to women in the postnatal period: A meta-synthesis of qualitative
studies.

INTRODUCTION: The postnatal period is an underserved aspect of maternity care.
Guidelines for postnatal care are not usually informed by what matters to the
women who use it. This qualitative systematic review was undertaken to identify
what matters to women in the postnatal period, to inform the scope of a new World
Health Organization (WHO) postnatal guideline.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, POPLINE, Global Index Medicus,
EMBASE, LILACS, AJOL, and reference lists of eligible studies published January
2000-July 2019, reporting qualitative data on women's beliefs, expectations, and 
values relating to the postnatal period.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Author findings were extracted, coded and
synthesised using techniques derived from thematic synthesis. Confidence in the
quality, coherence, relevance and adequacy of data underpinning the resulting
findings was assessed using GRADE-CERQual.
RESULTS: We included 36 studies from 15 countries, representing the views of more
than 800 women. Confidence in most results was moderate to high. What mattered to
women was a positive postnatal experience where they were able to adapt to their 
new self-identity and develop a sense of confidence and competence as a mother;
adjust to changes in their intimate and family relationships, including their
relationship to their baby; navigate ordinary physical and emotional challenges; 
and experience the dynamic achievement of personal growth as they adjust to the
'new normal' of motherhood and parenting in their own cultural context.
CONCLUSION: This review provides evidence that what matters to women in the
postnatal period is achieving positive motherhood (including maternal
self-esteem, competence, and autonomy), as well as fulfilling adaptation to
changed intimate and family relationships, and (re)gaining health and wellbeing
for both their baby, and themselves. Where this process is optimal, it also
results in joy, self-confidence, and an enhanced capacity to thrive in the new
integrated identity of 'woman and mother'.

eye to exert their beneficial effect on the residual retinal cells.
METHODS: The patients were subjected to a complete ophthalmological examination, 
including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), close-up visus measurements,
spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), microperimetry (MY), and
electroretinography (ERG). Furthermore, the complete ophthalmological examination
was carried out at baseline (T0) and at 6 months (T180) after surgery. The
Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess the normality of distribution of the
investigated parameters. A mixed linear regression model was used to analyse the 
difference in all the studied parameters at T0 and T180, and to compare the mean 
change between the two groups. All statistical analyses were performed with STATA
14.0 (Collage Station, Texas, USA).
RESULTS: LRRT treatment was performed in 34 eyes of 25 RP patients recruited for 
the study. The eyes were classified in two groups on the basis of foveal
thickness (FT) assessed by SD-OCT: 14 eyes in Group A (FT≤190μm) and the
remaining 20 ones in Group B (FT > 190μm). Although it had not reached the
statistical significance, Group B showed a better improvement in BCVA, residual
close-up visus and sensitivity than Group A.
CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies have described the role of LRRT in slowing down
retinal degenerative diseases. Consequently, this surgical procedure could
improve the clinical and rehabilitative prognostic parameters in RP patients. On 
the other hand, further clinical research and studies with longer follow-up will 
be needed to evaluate its efficacy.

and Hospital, Sumandeep Vidyapeeth University, Waghodia, Gujarat, India.

Context: Sense of coherence (SOC) is hypothesized to be an important
psychological factor that enables people to cope with stressors and successfully 
maintain and improve health.
Aim: This study was conducted with the aim to investigate the relationship
between oral health-related behaviors of autistic children and SOC of their
caregivers.
Settings and Design: An Exploratory cross sectional study was conducted to
investigate the association of oral health-related behaviors of autistic children
and their primary caregiver's sense of coherence in Vadodara city, Gujarat.
Methods and Results: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 58
autistic children and their caregivers. The Gujarati version of Antonovsky's SOC 
scale (13 items) was employed to assess the caregiver's SOC. The outcome
variables were the child's oral health-related behaviors, including frequency of 
sugary snack intake, toothbrushing frequency, and utilization of dental service.
Statistical Analysis Used: Multiple logistic regression was used to analyze the
relationship between the variables.
Results: Autistic children whose mothers (as caregivers) had higher SOC scores
had a lower frequency of sugary snack intake and greater utilization of dental
services compared with the children whose mothers had lower SOC scores. The other
measures of oral health-related behaviors of the child were not significantly
associated with the caregiver's SOC.
Conclusion: Oral health-related behaviors of autistic children, namely sugary
snack intake frequency, toothbrushing frequency, and utilization of dental
services, were associated with the SOC of their mothers.

A critique of Paulo Freire's perspective on human nature to inform the
construction of theoretical underpinnings for research.

Sanders K(1)(2).

This article presents a critique of Paulo Freire's philosophical perspective on
human nature in the context of a doctoral research study to explore "muchness" or
nurses' subjective experience of well-being; and demonstrates how this critique
has informed the refinement of the theoretical principles used to inform research
methodology and methods. Engaging in philosophical groundwork is essential for
research coherence and integrity. Through this groundwork, largely informed by
Freire's critical pedagogy and his ideas on humanization, I recognized the need
to clarify my understanding of the concepts of persons and personhood and how
this related to Freire's use of the term human beings. This clarification process
is essential to ensure congruence between the theoretical principles that I draw 
from his work and my beliefs about persons, personhood and person-centredness.
The article begins with a brief introduction to the research, followed by an
overview of Freire's philosophical perspectives, and subsequently, the critique
process is presented and discussed. This process involved engaging with the vast 
literature and debates about what it means to be a person, to make sense of the
often complex and contradictory arguments. Eventually, three headings emerged
that helped me to frame my evolving understanding: Our species: human beings; The
kind that we are: human nature; and This person that I am: personhood. Through
this process of exploration, I recognized that Freire's perspective on human
nature (a) foregrounded cognitive rationality, which presented itself as a
limitation when considering my ontological beliefs and the focus of my research, 
leading me to draw on the work of Mark Johnson and his ideas about embodiment to 
help me to further develop my theoretical principles; (b) focused on the
"collective" rather than individuals, which is a shortcoming in relation to
person-centred research that acknowledges the uniqueness of participants.

Perception of family sense of coherence during parental transition: A qualitative
study.

Ngai FW(1), Chan PS(1).

Author information:

This study described the perspectives and interplay of factors affecting the
family sense of coherence of Chinese couples during the perinatal period. We
adopted a grounded theory approach and conducted semi-structured interviews with 
36 Chinese couples during pregnancy and at 2-3 months postpartum. Four major
themes emerged involving meaningfulness, comprehensibility, and manageability of 
new parenthood and factors affecting the family sense of coherence. The strong
sense of family unity and harmony embedded in the Confucian philosophy and the
collective coping, in particular the strong social support network, seemed to
contribute to couple's experience of new parenthood as meaningful,
comprehensible, and manageable.

BACKGROUND: Many countries are engaged in primary care reforms to support older
adults who are living longer in the community. Health Teams Advancing Patient
Experience: Strengthening Quality [Health TAPESTRY] is a primary care
intervention aimed at supporting older adults that involves trained volunteers,
interprofessional teams, technology, and system navigation. This paper examines
implementation of Health TAPESTRY in relation to interprofessional teamwork
including volunteers.
METHODS: This study applied Normalization Process Theory (NPT) and used a
descriptive qualitative approach [1] embedded in a mixed-methods, pragmatic
randomized controlled trial. It was situated in two primary care practice sites
in a large urban setting in Ontario, Canada. Focus groups and interviews were
conducted with primary care providers, clinical managers, administrative
assistants, volunteers, and a volunteer coordinator. Data was collected at
4 months (June-July 2015) and 12 months (February-March 2016) after intervention 
start-up. Patients were interviewed at the end of the six-month intervention.
Field notes were taken at weekly huddle meetings.
RESULTS: Overall, 84 participants were included in 17 focus groups and 13
interviews; 24 field notes were collected. Themes were organized under four NPT
constructs of implementation: 1) Coherence- (making sense/understanding of the
program's purpose/value) generating comprehensive assessments of older adults;
strengthening health promotion, disease prevention, and self-management;
enhancing patient-focused care; strengthening interprofessional care delivery;
improving coordination of health and community services. 2) Cognitive
Participation- (enrolment/buy-in) tackling new ways of working; attaining role
clarity. 3) Collective Action- (enactment/operationalizing) changing team
processes; reconfiguring resources. 4) Reflective Monitoring- (appraisal)
improving teamwork and collaboration; reconfiguring roles and processes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes key strategies for effective implementation
of interventions involving interprofessional primary care teams. Findings
indicate that regular communication among all team members, the development of
procedures and/or protocols to support team processes, and ongoing review and
feedback are critical to implementation of innovations involving primary care
teams.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study evaluated the relationships of clinical consequences 
of untreated dental caries, individual characteristics, and environmental factors
on self-reported oral health measures in adolescents.
METHODS: A follow-up prevalence study was conducted involving 406 twelve-year-old
adolescents selected from public schools in the eastern area of the city of
Manaus, Brazil. Baseline data included clinical consequences of untreated caries 
(PUFA/pufa index), DMFT, sociodemographic characteristics (sex, parental
schooling, and family income), psychosocial factors (sense of coherence [SOC-13
scale], oral health beliefs and self-esteem [Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale]), and
social support (SSA questionnaire). Oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL
[CPQ11-14]) and self-rated oral health were assessed at the 6-month follow-up.
Structural equation modelling was used to explore the relationships between
variables according to the Wilson and Cleary model.
RESULTS: The prevalence of PUFA/pufa was 17.8% and mean DMFT was 1.5. The number 
of teeth with clinical consequences of untreated caries predicted poor self-rated
oral health at the 6-month follow-up. Low parental schooling predicted low family
income and clinical consequences of untreated dental caries. Psychosocial factors
predicted OHRQoL directly and self-rated oral health indirectly. OHRQoL was
linked to self-rated oral health. Clinical consequences of untreated dental
caries mediated the relationship of parental schooling with OHRQoL and self-rated
oral health. OHRQoL mediated the relationship of psychosocial factors and sex
with self-rated oral health. Clinical consequences of untreated dental caries was
associated with adolescents' self-rated oral health. Furthermore, the former was 
an important mediator on the link between low parental education and adolescents'
self-reported oral health measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic status, psychosocial factors, and social support were 
related to OHRQoL and self-rated oral health via direct and indirect pathways.

BACKGROUND: The Sense of Coherence (SOC) theory gives a possible explanation of
how people can experience subjective good health despite severe illness. Basic
self-disturbances (BSDs) are subtle non-psychotic disturbances that may
destabilize the person's sense of self, identity, corporeality, and the overall
'grip' of the world.
AIM: Our objective was to investigate associations between BSDs and SOC in
patients with psychotic disorders.
DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study of 56 patients diagnosed with psychotic
disorders inside and outside the schizophrenia spectrum (35 schizophrenia, 13
bipolar, and eight other psychoses). SOC was measured using Antonovsky's 13-item 
SOC questionnaire, and BSDs were assessed using the Examination of Anomalous
Self-Experience (EASE) manual. Diagnosis, symptoms, and social and occupational
performance were assessed using standardized clinical instruments.
RESULTS: We found a statistically significant correlation (r = ) between high
levels of BSDs and low levels of SOC (r = -0.64/p<0.001). This association was
not influenced by diagnostics, clinical symptoms or level of functioning in
follow-up multivariate analyses.
CONCLUSION: A statistically significant association between BSDs and SOC
indicates that the presence and level of self-disturbances may influence the
person's ability to experience life as comprehensive, manageable and meaningful. 
However, the cross-sectional nature of the study precludes conclusions regarding 
the direction of this association.

PURPOSE: This study aims to explore the relation between the dimension of fear of
cancer recurrence (FCR) in haematological cancer patients relapse-free for at
least 2 years and socio-demographic, related to the disease, psychological and
existential factors.
METHODS: A sample of 75 haematological cancer patients agreed to participate in
the study through a self-reported online questionnaire (51.9% males). A total of 
70.1% had a low recurrence risk. The questionnaire included socio-demographic
(gender, age, civil status, level of education and number of children), related
to the disease (diagnosis, therapeutic line and years since diagnosis),
psychological (anxiety and depression), existential (purpose in life; PIL)
factors and Fear of Cancer Recurrence Concerns Inventory (FCRI). Simple and
multiple linear regressions were conducted for the analyses, and we performed
some preliminary analysis on the reliability of the FCRI.
FINDINGS: A total of 53.3% of participants showed clinical levels of FCR on the
severity dimension, which was higher than found in previous research in other
cancer patients. The coping strategies, triggers, severity and psychological
distress dimensions showed higher mean values. Women, patients with indolent
non-Hodgkin lymphomas, years since diagnosis, anxiety and purpose in life are
significantly related to one or more dimensions of FCRI.
IMPLICATIONS: It is important that the clinicians have at their disposal multiple
possibilities to help patients cope with haematological cancer. If future
research will confirm the results of this study, the negative correlation between
FCR and PIL can suggest indications for planning interventions based on a
salutogenic approach.

Objective: To qualitatively evaluate the implementation of Capacity Coaching, an 
intervention to address the work patients must undertake to manage their
conditions, implemented as a quality improvement pilot in 1 of 2 implementing US 
Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers.
Participants and Methods: Two Veterans Affairs medical centers in the Midwest
sought to implement Capacity Coaching as a quality improvement pilot in their
Patient-Aligned Care Teams for 6 months (April 1, 2017, through October 31,
2017). Following the pilot, we conducted a focused ethnographic evaluation
(on-site data collection, January 2-4, 2018), including interviews, a focus
group, and observations with staff at one site to assess the implementation of
capacity coaching. Data were analyzed inductively and findings were
cross-referenced with implementation theory.
Results: We found that implementation was feasible and achieved changes that were
aligned with reducing patient work and increasing capacity. We found that the key
facilitators for the implementation of this program were in participants making
sense of the intervention (coherence) and working collectively to enact the
program (collective action). The main challenges for the program were in planning
the work of implementation and enrolling a diverse coalition of staff to expand
referrals to the program (cognitive participation) and in evaluating the impact
of the program on outcomes that upper leadership was interested in (reflexive
monitoring).
Conclusion: Implementation of Capacity Coaching is feasible in clinical practice 
and may be a promising intervention for the care of chronic conditions. Further
research should focus on testing capacity coaching using these lessons learned.

The Relationship between Dog Ownership, Psychopathological Symptoms and
Health-Benefitting Factors in Occupations at Risk for Traumatization.

Individuals working in high-risk occupations (e.g., emergency staff) are exposed 
to high levels of occupational stress including traumatic events.
Correspondingly, several studies report high rates of mental health problems
among these occupations. Pet ownership has been associated with better mental
health. However, to date a study on the association between pet ownership and
indicators of mental health in these occupations is missing. The present
cross-sectional survey (N = 580) investigated pet ownership, attachment to pets, 
health-benefitting factors (i.e., sense of coherence, trait-resilience, locus of 
control) and psychopathological symptoms (i.e., general mental health problems,
posttraumatic stress, burnout) in medical staff, police officers, and
firefighters. Dog owners and non-dog owners showed comparable levels of
psychopathological distress and health-benefitting factors. Compared to cat
owners, dog owners demonstrated stronger emotional attachment to their pet.
Moreover, a stronger attachment was also linked to higher levels of
psychopathological symptoms and lower levels of health-benefitting factors.
However, the relationship between attachment to pets and health-benefitting
factors could be explained by their overlap with psychopathological symptom
levels. Overall, our findings are not in line with the notion that pet ownership 
generally has a health-benefitting effect. Future studies need to investigate
circumstances that modulate positive effects of pet ownership.

Mind-body medicine (MBM) is based on the assumption that interactions between the
brain, mind, body, and behavior can be used to activate health-promoting pathways
towards better health. It includes behavioral medical approaches and techniques
in conjunction with exercise, relaxation, stress regulation, and nutrition. MBM
and MBM interventions are well-established in the US healthcare system. This also
includes an exploration of their underlying mechanisms. In Germany, too,
a growing body of interventions are now summarized under this generic term.In
this narrative review, the emergence of MBM is illuminated in the context of
historical developments as well as against the background of the meditation
research that has been emerging since the 1970s and the investigation of the
stress phenomenon. References to basic research including neurobiological
reward/placebo physiology are presented. Distinctions to psychotherapy are made
and an implementation framework is described.MBM is related to health promotion
and the therapy of chronic, especially lifestyle-related diseases. It is based on
the salutogenesis approach, i.e., a paradigm that seeks to explore and reinforce 
health determinants and resistance resources (individual resilience and coherence
factors) and strives to reduce stress. This approach corresponds to self-healing 
or self-care principles. Neurobiologically, it is associated with the placebo
effect. MBM interventions typically follow the BERN model
(behavior-exercise-relaxation-nutrition).As a facilitator of self-healing and
self-care, MBM can be professionally trained and empowered. For doing so, "health
promotion experts" are used.

This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the association between the Sense
of Coherence and impact of oral health on the quality of life. Was conducted with
a sample of 720 individuals of both sexes, between the ages of 50 and 74 years,
selected through multistage proportional random sampling. The data collection
instruments used were: short version of the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-13),
Oral Impacts on Daily Performances (OIDP) questionnaire, oral clinical
examination and questionnaire containing socio demographic and use of dental
services information. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed through 
Poisson regression adjusted for robust variance, with level of significance p <
0.05. Oral impacts were reported by 416 participants (57.8%). In the adjusted
model, those with strong SOC were more likely of not having any impact when
compared with individuals with weak SOC (PR=1.30). Need for dental prosthesis was
also associated with the outcome, individuals who did not require prosthesis had 
less impact (PR=1.50). The findings showed that SOC is associated with OIDP,
supporting the hypothesis that individuals with strong SOC present a lower impact
of oral health on the quality of life, suggesting that SOC is a determinant that 
can provide protection against that impact.

The Experience of Tinnitus and Its Interaction With Unique Life Histories-Life
Events, Trauma and Inner Resources Narrated by Patients With Tinnitus.

France.

Background: The challenges facing people with chronic tinnitus include finding
relief and rebuilding quality of life. However, previous traumatic episodes may
influence adjustment and prolong suffering. Recovery implies reducing aggravating
reactions and improving social roles, relationships and interests.
Self-narratives about living with tinnitus have not yet received the attention
they deserve in the research literature. Thus, the main goal of the present study
was to illustrate how tinnitus suffering interacts with the participants' unique 
life histories. Method: Four women and one man (ages 52-58) took part in the
study after consulting a special hearing clinic for annoying tinnitus. Criteria
for inclusion were that tinnitus was regarded as a problem with negative
consequences for quality of life. The participants should be willing to share how
the experience of tinnitus suffering interacts with their previous life story.
Narrative methodology was employed in order to achieve the goals of the study. We
used unstructured interviews with free conversation, which allowed for rich
narratives with full contextual meaning. Results: The findings, based on the
narrative analysis, revealed that three out of five participants presented a
regressive form of narrative indicating ongoing struggles beyond tinnitus itself,
which they were unable to bring to closure. For them, valued goals were
continuously thwarted by frustrating circumstances in their lives, either past
events or current unresolved issues. Progressive and stable narratives, as
identified in the other two participants, demonstrated values that rely on
others' attitude and understanding toward their suffering, in sharp contrast to
the regressive narratives. We suggest that a central issue in tinnitus
rehabilitation should be to help suffering patients to overcome unresolved
conflicts and thereby extend their ability for a fuller commitment in life.
Conclusion: Considering enduring tinnitus as a chronic condition, whose course is
likely to vary depending on the patient's general health status, an alteration of
progressive and stable narratives is likely to occur during the lifespan. A
progressive narrative shows similarities to the core construct of the
salutogenesis model of health promotion (1). In conclusion, a narrative approach 
in tinnitus rehabilitation can be health promoting by offering the patient the
opportunity to engage in storytelling, which in turn can increase
comprehensibility and a sense of coherence.

Purpose: This study explored whether the holistic theory of salutogenesis may be 
a suitable theoretical framework for the Clubhouse model of psychosocial
rehabilitation, a pioneer among psychosocial rehabilitation programmes.Methods: A
systematic examination of elements of the Clubhouse model, as prescribed by the
Clubhouse standards, was performed within the context of the theory of
salutogenesis including its basic salutogenic orientation and the main concepts
of sense of coherence and resistance resources.Results: We found that several
standards and practices within the Clubhouse model can be understood as
applications of salutogenesis. We have hypothesized that the Clubhouse model
promotes peoples' sense of coherence and mental health. However, our
investigation also showed that, to enhance the recovery of Clubhouse members,
more explicitly incorporating some salutogenic principles, such as "appropriate
challenges" and "active adaptation as the ideal in treatment", may benefit
Clubhouse practice.Conclusions: The Clubhouse model of psychosocial
rehabilitation is very consistent with the salutogenic orientation and main
salutogenic concepts. The present study suggests that salutogenesis may be a
suitable theoretical framework for the Clubhouse model and possibly in the
psychosocial rehabilitation field in general.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of Tai Chi (TC) in patients with myocardial
infarction and provide up-to-date evidence for its application.
DATA SOURCES: Three English databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials) and 3 Chinese databases (China Knowledge Resource 
Integrated, Wanfang, Weipu) were screened for the time period between January 1, 
1976 and May 31, 2019.
STUDY SELECTION: Seven randomized and controlled experiments were included.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent researchers under 2 independent advisors
extracted and classified the data from all relevant studies based on the
prespecified inclusion criteria and rules for data extraction.
DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 615 patients were included in this study. The TC group
was comprised of 294 patients, and the control group included 261 patients. The
results revealed that TC has significant effects on the outcomes of the 6-minute 
walk (standardized mean difference, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-2.11) and
left ventricular ejection fraction (standardized mean difference, 1; 95%
confidence interval, 0.43-1.57) compared with no or low-density exercise. Also,
TC positively affected the quality of life, pro-B type natriuretic peptide, and
short form-36. However, TC did not significantly affect activities of daily
living (P=.060), sense of coherence-13 (P=.057) and N-terminal-pro-brain
natriuretic peptide (P=.081). A moderate to high heterogeneity was observed
across all comparisons.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with no exercise or other types of low-intensity physical
activities, TC improved the outcome of the 6-minute walk, left ventricular
ejection fraction, quality of life, and short form-36 scores, but reduced the
outcome of pro-B type natriuretic peptide in patients with myocardial infarction.
Therefore, TC could be an effective exercise option for cardiac rehabilitation.
More research should be done to identify the effects of TC on academic
functioning and to determine ways of motivating patients to use preventive TC
interventions.

We studied Finnish 18-year-old males attending obligatory military call-up
assessments in 1999 (n = 2340) and 2009 (n = 4309) on time-trend changes in
psychosocial well-being, psychopathology, substance use, suicidality, bullying,
and sense of coherence. Subjects filled in questionnaires, including the Young
Adult Self-Report (YASR) for psychopathology and the Orientation to Life
Questionnaire (SOC-13) for sense of coherence. The prevalence of minor mental
health problems in the last 6 months decreased from 22.3% in 1999 to 18.6% in
2009 (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7-0.9), whereas severe mental health problems remained
stable. Suicidal thoughts decreased from 5.7 to 3.7% (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.8).
The use of illicit drugs decreased from 6.0 to 4.7% (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.6-0.95),
but being drunk at least once a week increased from 10.3 to 13.4% (OR 1.3, 95% CI
1.0-1.5). Attention problems increased in YASR syndrome domains (mean score 2.9
vs 3.2, p < 0.001) and so did somatic complains (mean score 1.7 vs 1.9,
p = 0.005). The SOC-13 scores remained stable. The percentage of males who had
studied during the past 6 months increased from 91.4 to 93.4% (OR 1.3, 95% CI
1.1-1.6), while being employed decreased from 64.9 to 49.4% (OR 0.5, 95% CI
0.5-0.6). The positive findings included reductions in the prevalence of suicidal
thoughts and the use of illicit drugs, but being drunk at least once a week
increased. Self-reported somatic problems and attention problems increased.
Despite changes in society and family structures, there were only minor overall
changes in psychopathology.

Healing Health Care: From Sick Care Towards Salutogenic Healing Systems.

Building, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2 Canada.

Aaron Antonovsky's salutogenic model is starting to impact health promotion at
the level of theory and research. However, the benefits of Antonovsky's theory
for population health promotion practices and health care restructuring are
unrealized. This analysis uses the definition of health derived from complexity
science as a lifelong, multidimensional adaptive process comprised of
intersecting biological, psychological, social, environmental, and spiritual
systems as a starting point for a salutogenic analysis of formal healthcare.
Following Antonovsky's criticism of contemporary healthcare as resting upon a
pathogenic paradigm, I outline four general shortcomings associated with the
pathogenic approach to healthcare. The basic elements of a healthcare system
designed according to principles derived from Antonovsky's salutogenic model of
health are then presented. It is argued that Antonovsky's theory offers a
productive basis for conceptualizing health and healthcare systems in that it
allows us to grasp that debates between population health promotion and providing
medical care, are, at their root, unproductive debates predicated on a false
dichotomy. A salutogenic healthcare system is one which pays credence to the
nested complexity of human health and strives to strike an adaptive balance
between health production and the provision of medical care.

Psychotherapy, Steinhövelstrasse 5, 89075 Ulm, Germany.

Background: Professional caregivers are exposed to multiple stressors and have
high burnout rates; however, not all individuals are equally susceptible. We
investigated the association between resilience and burnout in a Swiss population
of professional caregivers working in youth residential care. Methods: Using a
prospective longitudinal study design, participants (n = 159; 57.9% women)
reported on burnout symptoms and sense of coherence (SOC), self-efficacy and
self-care at four annual sampling points. The associations of individual
resilience measures and sociodemographic variables, work-related and personal
stressors, and burnout symptoms were assessed. Cox proportional hazards
regressions were calculated to compute hazard ratios over the course of three
years. Results: Higher SOC, self-efficacy and self-care were related to lower
burnout symptoms in work-related and personal domains. Higher SOC and
self-efficacy were reported by older caregivers and by those with children. All
three resilience measures were highly correlated. A combined model analysis
weakened the protective effect of self-efficacy, leaving only SOC and self-care
negatively associated with burnout. Conclusion: This longitudinal analysis
suggests that SOC and self-caring behaviour in particular protect against
burnout. Our findings could have implications for promoting self-care practices, 
as well as cultivating a meaningful, comprehensible and manageable professional
climate in all facets of institutional care.

BACKGROUND: Young adults at the age of 25-29 in Denmark have the highest
unemployment rate and are at higher risk of labour market marginalization.
Exclusion from the labour market may have negative individual consequences on
mental and physical health and can lead to increasing societal expenditures due
to social benefits. It is important to understand what factors determine or
protect against early labour market marginalization. The aim of the present study
was to investigate the association between psychological resources in adolescence
and labour market participation in early adulthood, and whether the associations 
differed by gender.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study used questionnaire data collected through 
the West Jutland Cohort study in 2004 and 2007. The study population (N = 2982)
consisted of people born in 1989 and living in the county of Ringkjoebing at
baseline in 2004. Outcome was dichotomized as +/- 12 months of passive labour
market participation during the age of 25-29. Psychological resources were
measured as self-esteem, sense of coherence and mastery. Logistic regression
analyses were performed to investigate the associations between psychological
resources and labour market participation.
RESULTS: Results indicated associations between high levels of mastery or sense
of coherence in adolescence and high labour market participation in early
adulthood. The strongest associations were observed for females with a medium
(OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.8) or high level (OR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0-2.4) of mastery or
a high level of sense of coherence (OR: 1.6 95% CI: 1.0-2.4) at age 15 and for
males with a medium (OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.5-3.8) or high (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.5)
level of mastery or a high level of sense of coherence (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 0.9-3.1)
at age 18.
CONCLUSION: The results of the present study indicate associations between a high
level of sense of coherence or mastery in adolescence and high labour market
participation in early adulthood in a Danish context. Psychological resources
seemed to play a bigger role for females in early adolescence compared to males, 
for whom a larger impact was seen in late adolescence.

According to national hospice data in Hungary, approximately 1,600 healthcare
employees and volunteers work in hospice care (country population of 9.9
million). The aim of the study was to identify and examine influential
relationships among several variables that may affect well-being among female
hospice workers. Structural equation modeling analysis was conducted utilising
survey responses of 179 female hospice workers, including 79 nurses. Path
analysis revealed that work over-commitment (being employed in more than one job)
contributed to decreased psychological well-being through increased perceived
stress, sleep difficulties and vital exhaustion. A greater sense of coherence was
associated with lower levels of subjective stress, depressive symptoms and vital 
exhaustion and negatively correlated with over-commitment. Overall, even though
the physical and mental burden of the workers is increasing because of increased 
use of hospice, according to these results, most still engaged in hospice work.
Deeper analysis of the sense of coherence may point to development of effective
interventions that can help maintain well-being of hospice workers and reduce
attrition.

All that I need exists within me: A qualitative study of nulliparous Norwegian
women's experiences with planned home birth.

7004 Trondheim, Norway.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to gain knowledge regarding how Norwegian
nulliparous women experience planned home birth and why they choose this route of
giving birth.
DESIGN: A qualitative approach was used, and the study data were derived from
semi-structured individual interviews, which were analysed through systematic
text condensation.
PARTICIPANTS: Ten Norwegian women aged nineteen to thirty-nine years were
interviewed. They had each gone through with a successful planned home birth of
their first child within the last two years. These women all resided in the
middle, western and eastern areas of Norway. A certified midwife was present
throughout the labour and birth, and no transfer to the hospital was necessary.
FINDINGS: The following two main themes were identified: 'inner motivation' and
'giving birth in safe surroundings'. The women in this study had a strong inner
faith in the normal physiological processes of labour and birth and had educated 
and prepared themselves carefully for their planned home birth. To be able to
enter one's own inner world was considered crucial for labour, and the trusting
relationship they had with their midwife made this possible.
KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Planned home birth may be
experienced as a very positive occurrence for nulliparous women, and the care
those women in this study received contained several elements that can help to
promote normal labour and birth at a time in which reducing interventions in
maternity care is of importance. Their positive birth experiences gave the women 
confidence both in their transition to motherhood as well as in other aspects of 
life.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the typology of implemented salutogenic interventions and
the health effects described by the authors.
METHOD: A scoping review of the literature published (PubMed, Embase, Web of
Science and Scopus) over the last ten years (2007-2016) was conducted. Articles
that included interventions with assessments of health outcomes were selected for
this review. The kappa index (86.4%) was calculated for the classification and
extraction of information.
RESULTS: 61 papers were selected out of the 676 works identified. These were
categorized into individual, grouped, mixed and intersectoral interventions. A
total of 85% of the interventions described positive effects. Adverse effects
were not reported. Methodological limitations were identified in 75% of the
papers. The interventions addressed a large variety of topics, especially in the 
field of mental health and chronic diseases. Collective actions described more
positive effects. Intersectoral actions were the only type of interventions to
have approached the impact of mortality reduction.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the existence of positive health effects of
salutogenic approaches. Important methodological limitations were identified,
such as biases in the selection of participants and sample sizes. Studies need to
be conducted with improved monitoring and evaluation designs. A more robust
theoretical framework and tools to evaluate the salutogenic contents are needed.

INTRODUCTION: Residency is a stressful phase associated with high prevalence of
mental distress. Besides impaired personal health, mental distress in residents
has an impact on the quality of patient care and produces economic costs.
Therefore, there is demand for interventions that improve resident physicians'
mental health. The aim of the present study is to examine the effects of a
mindfulness-based intervention that has been tailored to residents' needs.
Specifically, mindfulness has been supplemented by a focus on the concept of
Muße.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study applies a randomised controlled multimethod
design. Residents assigned to the intervention group will participate in an
8-week mindfulness course followed by a 4-month maintenance phase, whereas
residents assigned to the control group will read text-based information about
mindfulness on a weekly basis for the duration of 8 weeks. The intervention is
focussed on a transfer of learnt techniques into the daily routine and is
targeted to promote residents' self-care as well as on building empathic
relationships. Participants will be assessed before, directly after the
intervention, after the maintenance phase as well as at follow-up 6 months after 
the intervention group completes the intervention. Assessments will consist of
self-report measures, physiological data, qualitative interviews, third-party
reports as well as implicit and projective measures and will focus on both
psychopathology and salutogenesis. The primary outcome will be burnout. Data will
be analysed using linear mixed modelling.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the ethics committee of the
Medical Center - University of Freiburg and is funded by the German Research
Foundation as part of the interdisciplinary Collaborative Research Center 'SFB
Muße 1015'. The results of this study will be published in scientific journals
and disseminated through the study's website, and conferences.

OBJECTIVE: High stress levels experienced by medical professionals are a
well-established phenomenon in current literature. However, there are few studies
focusing on stress experienced in the field of oral health or on the sense of
coherence (SOC) that helps to actively respond to job stress. The purpose of this
study was to analyse if there is an association between SOC and job stress among 
dental hygienists in Korea.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a convenience sample of 441
dental hygienists in the Seoul Gyeonggi province, Korea. The independent variable
was SOC which had three dimensions: comprehensibility, manageability and
meaningfulness. The dependent variable was job stress, which was evaluated using 
the Korean Occupational Stress Scale Short Form. Confounding factors were age,
marital status, educational background, type of hospital, and work experience.
The chi-square test and t test measures were used for bivariate analysis.
Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to confirm the association
between SOC and job stress. The collected data were statistically analysed using 
SPSS version 22.0.
RESULTS: The SOC score showed a significant difference in relation to the job
stress score. The SOC score was high when the job stress was low (P < .001).
Overall SOC scores showed an inverse correlation with job stress.
CONCLUSION: This study reports that a higher SOC is associated with lower job
stress in Korean dental hygienists. Since a higher SOC in dental hygienists
indicated that they could cope with job stress more positively, it is important
to increase their SOC.

neuroelectrophysiological results, MRI imaging, treatment and prognosis of
children diagnosed with MOG-ON from 2016 to 2019 were retrospectively analyzed.
Results: A total of 29 eyes from 16 children were involved, with a male/female
ratio of 1∶1, onset age of (7.0±2.9) years. Seven of 16 patients had prodromal
infection, with a unilateral/bilateral ratio of 3∶13, and 2 cases had recurrent
optic neuritis. Before treatment, BCVA of 19 eyes (65.5%) was ≤0.1, among them, 4
had no sense of light, 5 had light sense, 5 with sense of hands in front of eyes,
and 5 with sense of fingers in front of eyes. There were 10 eyes (34.5%) with
BCVA of 0.1-0.5. After treatment, there were 4 eyes (13.8%), 5 eyes (17.2%) and
20 eyes (69.0%) in groups with BCVA of 0.1-0.5, 0.5-1.0, and>1.0, respectively.
Twelve of 16 patients had optic papillitis in fundus examination during acute
phase. The latency was prolonged and the amplitude was decreased in P100 wave of 
all the children. Thirteen out of 16 children showed swelling and thickening of
optic nerve in MRI T2WI. MRI images exhibited intracranial demyelinating lesions 
in 12 of 16 children and long segment spinal cord lesions in 3 of 16 children.
Thirteen of 16 patients showed effective results after intravenous
methylprednisolone (IVMP) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment. There 
was no relapse after administration of mycophenolate mofetil in 2 recurrent
children. No progression after administration of rituximab was found in 1 child
with corticosteroid insensitivity. The average follow-up time was (16±9) months
and no recurrence occurred. Ten of 16 patients had full recovery, 4 had
significant improvement, and 2 showed no significant improvement. Conclusions:
There is no significant gender difference in the incidence of pediatric MOG-ON.
Bilateral involvement and severe visual impairment are common in acute phase.
Most patients have good response to IVMP combined with IVIG treatment and hence
have a good prognosis. Only a few of them have neurological sequelae.

Interdisciplinary study of addiction is facilitated by relative unification of
the concept. What should be sought is not formal unification through literal
analytic definition, which would undermine practical flexibility within
disciplines and intervention practices. However, leading controversies around
whether addiction should be conceived as a 'disease', and over whether addiction 
is 'chosen' behavior, are made more difficult to resolve by failure to apply
philosophical reflection on these general concepts. Such reflection should be
sensitive to two kinds of constraint: coherence in description of empirical,
including neuroscientific, observation, and utility in framing normative goals in
treatment and policy design. Following review of various interpretations of
addiction, disease, and choice across contributing disciplines, it is concluded
that addiction is most plausibly viewed as a disease at the scale of public
health research and policy, but not personal (e.g. clinical) management and
intervention. Addicts must make choices to recover, and in that respect addiction
is a 'disorder of choice'. However, it is concluded that the most relevant sense 
of 'disorder' arises at the social rather than the personal scale.

Background: Nurses experience high levels of distress due to the nature of their 
work and workplaces; Antonovsky's salutogenic theory shows that individual and
work-related factors can influence human health. The aim of this paper is to
analyze the possible correlations with different work-related and individual
variables, which influence or are influenced by Sense of Coherence (SOC) and
verify the possible use of SOC scales to prevent negative health determinants in 
workplaces. Methods: Electronic databases were searched with selected studies
compared for sample, sample size, study design and basic results. Cross-sectional
studies were reviewed for correlations between individual physical and mental
health, distress, burnout, job satisfaction and SOC, with intervention studies
used to assess the possible impact of training on nurses' SOC. Results: The
review found several correlations between SOC and different work-related
variables; but also with several individual characteristics. Conclusion: The
review found that SOC was predictor of depressive state, burnout, job
dissatisfaction among female nurses; therefore, SOC could be a health promoting
resource.

Research has pursued salutogenic and narrative approaches to deal with questions 
about how everyday settings are constitutive for different health practices.
Healthy behavior is not a distinguishable action, but a chain of activities,
often embedded in other social practices. In this article, we have endeavored to 
describe such a chain of activities guided by the salutogenic claim of exploring 
the good living argued by McCuaig and Quennerstedt. We use biographical material 
written by Karl Ove Knausgaard who has created a life story entitled My Struggle.
The novel is selected upon an approach influenced by Brinkmann who stresses that 
literature can be seen as a qualitative social inquiry in which the novelist is
an expert in transforming personal life experiences into common human expressions
of life. The study illustrates how research with a broader notion of health can
convey experiences of health, thereby complementing (and sometimes challenging)
public health evidence.

"I want to go home": How location at death influences caregiver well-being in
bereavement.

OBJECTIVES: Goal concordant or congruent care involves having expressed wishes
upheld. Yet, the preferred location for end-of-life care may be unaddressed.
Caregiver-patient congruence between preferred and actual locations of care may
influence the quality of life in bereavement. The study aimed to explore how the 
congruence between caregiver-patient preferred and actual locations of death
influenced well-being in bereavement.
METHODS: Mixed methods were employed. In-depth in-person interviews were
conducted with 108 bereaved caregivers of a hospice patient about 4 months after 
the death. An interview guide was used to collect quantitative and qualitative
data: demographics, decision-making, Core Bereavement Items (CBI), Health Related
Quality of Life, and perspectives on the end-of-life experiences. Data were
analyzed with a convergent mixed methods one-phase process.
RESULTS: Patient preference-actual location congruence occurred for 53%;
caregiver preference-actual location congruence occurred for 74%;
caregiver-patient preference and location of death occurred for 48%. Participants
who reported some type of incongruence demonstrated higher levels of distress,
including more days of being physically and emotionally unwell and more intense
bereavement symptoms. The Acute Separation subscale and CBI total scores
demonstrated significant differences for participants who experienced
incongruence compared with those who did not. Preference location congruence
themes emerged: (1) caregiver-patient location congruence, (2) caregiver-patient 
location incongruence, and (3) location informed bereavement.
CONCLUSIONS: Congruence between a dying person's preferred and actual locations
at death has been considered good care. There has been little focus on the
reciprocity between caregiver-patient wishes. Discussing preferences about the
place of end-stage care may not make location congruence possible, but it can
foster shared understanding and support for caregivers' sense of coherence and
well-being in bereavement.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic pain and fatigue are the main symptoms of postpoliomyelitis
syndrome (PPS). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an
anthroposophic multimodal treatment for chronic pain in PPS outpatients.
METHODS: A twelve-week, four-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
phase 2 prospective clinical trial was designed to compare four groups (n = 48): 
groups A and B received daily active experimental transdermal gel (ETG) or
placebo gel (PTG), respectively; groups C and D received weekly external
therapies, art therapies, and neurofunctional reorganization, plus either daily
ETG or PTG, respectively. The pain symptoms were evaluated through a visual
analogue scale (VAS), the McGill questionnaire, and thermography. Quality of life
and resilience were evaluated by the WHOQOL-BREF and Antonovsky sense of
coherence questionnaires applied at baseline and after the interventions.
RESULTS: No related adverse events occurred, and 10% of the patients reports
dysphagia improvement. In the groups C and D, pain reduction was statistically
significant in both the placebo group (p = .02, d = 1.315) and in the ETG
(p = .005, d = 2.035). However, following the week-to-week evolution of pain with
the concomitant use of the ETG, this significant pain reduction occurred earlier 
from the 4th week and continued to decrease (p = .016, d = 1.369). In the group
that received the complete multimodal treatment, the greatest significant benefit
in increasing quality of life occurred in the physical domain and elevation in
resilience with an emphasis on meaning and comprehension domains.
CONCLUSIONS: The anthroposophic multimodal treatment group presented both safety 
and efficacy as an analgesic in the groups that received the nonpharmacological
therapies, much earlier when associated with the ETG. The multimodal approach
corresponded to the pattern of better efficacy for both pain reduction and
improvement in quality of life and resilience.

STUDY DESIGN: A nonblinded randomized controlled trial.
INTRODUCTION: Occupation-based interventions are superior to physical
exercise-based interventions in patients with activity limitations. However, only
a few studies have examined the effect in patients with hand-related disorders.
Patients recover heterogeneously, which could be due to personal factors, such as
sense of coherence (SOC).
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effectiveness of an occupation-based
intervention for patients with hand-related disorders and whether SOC can give an
indication of the expected effects.
METHODS: A total of 504 patients were stratified into three SOC groups and then
randomized to either an occupation-based intervention, including physical
exercises (OBI) or a physical exercise-based occupation-focused intervention. The
primary outcome, functioning, was measured using the Disability of the Arm,
Shoulder and Hand questionnaire. Primary endpoint was at three months. Patients
were followed up for a year.
RESULTS: No significant difference was found in primary outcome analysis.
Nevertheless, patients receiving OBI had a statistically significant and greater 
change in satisfaction with their occupational performance at one, two, and three
months follow-up. Patients with a weak SOC had worse functioning and lower
health-related quality of life than those in the other groups, at all times.
CONCLUSIONS: OBI as delivered in this study was not superior to physical
exercise-based occupation-focused intervention in this patient group. However, in
taking a client-centered approach, we recommend that OBI be based on individual
needs, given that patients had a statistically greater change in score regarding 
satisfaction with their occupational performance. It is evident that patients
with a weaker SOC have a lower level of functioning. This knowledge should inform
clinical practice.

PURPOSE: This study examined the Sense of Coherence (SOC) of patients
participating in the randomized controlled 'Optimal Training for Women with
Breast Cancer' (OptiTrain) study and assessed how patient characteristics were
associated with SOC. Secondary aims were to assess the association between SOC
and patients' participation in this study and to determine whether SOC moderates 
the effect of the 16-week exercise intervention on fatigue, quality of life
(QoL), and symptom burden in women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.
METHODS: Modified Poisson regression analyses were conducted to determine the
relative risk of weak-normal SOC versus strong SOC in terms of exercise session
attendance, study and intervention dropout, and long absence rates. Analyses of
covariance were performed to assess whether SOC moderated the effect of the
exercise intervention (pinteraction ≤ 0.10).
RESULTS: Two hundred and forty women with early breast cancer (mean age 53 ± 10) 
participated in the OptiTrain study. Women with strong SOC reported less fatigue,
lower symptom burden, and higher QoL. Women with weak-normal SOC were
significantly more likely to drop out from the OptiTrain study and tended to have
slightly poorer exercise session attendance. Women with breast cancer and weaker 
SOC benefitted as much from the exercise intervention, in terms of fatigue and
QoL, as those with stronger SOC (pinteraction > 0.10).
CONCLUSIONS: Strong SOC appears to be associated with a more positive subjective 
state of health. Women with weak-normal SOC may need additional support to
encourage participation and adherence in exercise trials. Assessing SOC may
assist clinicians to identify and provide extra support for participants with
weak SOC, who may be less inclined to participate in exercise programs.

Untreated caries is the most prevalent disease in the world. A sense of coherence
(SOC) is believed to contribute to oral health. We aimed to clarify the
association between guardians' SOC and their children's caries based on
socioeconomic status (SES) in Japan. This study's subjects were Japanese public
junior high schoolers (N = 1730), aged 12-15, and their guardians in Kosai City. 
We administered a questionnaire survey among guardians in 2016 to assess their
SOC and family environment. With their students' consent, public junior high
schools shared the results of the dental examinations that were part of their
school physicals. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to clarify the
association between guardians' SOC and their children's untreated decayed
permanent teeth. We also conducted a stratified analysis according to a relative 
poverty line. We observed in the multivariate regression a significant inverse
association between children's untreated decay and their guardians' SOC (OR 0.93,
95%CI 0.87-1.00). The association of SOC was stronger in the low economic group
(OR 0.64, 95%CI 0.43-0.95). Guardians with higher SOC were associated with
children having fewer caries. Guardians' SOC is a factor for the prevalence of
caries and access to dental care, especially among children with low economic
status.

OBJECTIVE: Asylum seekers who have experienced persecution, war and torture show 
high prevalence rates of stress-related mental disorders. After arrival in the
host country, the early stages of resettlement seem to be a particularly
vulnerable phase characterized by social instability. This longitudinal study
aimed to explore predictors of the asylum seekers' course of mental health during
the transition phase from a state registration and reception center to municipal 
shelters.
METHODS: We used hierarchical regression analysis to assess the symptom course of
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety and panic disorders as 
well as well-being in n = 84 asylum seekers. The follow-up assessment took place 
three to five months after baseline assessment. The following blocks of possible 
predictors were included in the statistical models: (1) sociodemographic
variables, (2) cultural background related variables, (3) psychometric measures
of emotion regulation and sense of coherence and (4) time range to follow-up.
RESULTS: Language proficiency, origin, religion and gender were stronger
predictors of the asylum seekers' mental health course in the early stages of
resettlement than emotion regulation and sense of coherence.
CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographic and cultural background related variables, like
language proficiency have a high psychosocial relevance for asylum seekers in the
early phase of the asylum process. Therefore, language courses should be
implemented progressively. Psychotherapy for asylum seekers should always be
performed with awareness for cultural specific perspectives and acculturative
adjustment processes.

Purpose of review: This paper critically evaluates literature from the last three
years on sleep in caregivers for older adults. Research is evaluated in four main
areas: factors related to caregivers having sleep problems, sleep health in
various types of caregivers, how caregivers' sleep and health inter-relate, and
interventions to improve sleep.
Recent findings: A range of both care recipients' and caregivers' characteristics
have been associated with caregiver sleep quality measured subjectively and
objectively. Care recipient factors associated with caregiver sleep quality
include fall risk and sleep quality, while caregiver factors include stress,
duration, intensity, provision of medical/nursing care tasks, and even particular
serotonin genotypes (e.g. short allele carriers for 5-HTTLPR). While the greatest
focus has been on dementia caregivers, recent work suggests groups such as
end-of-life caregivers, former caregivers, and caregivers with multiple care
roles (e.g. child, older adult, paid care) have sleep disturbances that vary by
their unique contexts. Caregiver's sleep, particularly subjective assessments,
relates to their mood and physiological well-being; and evidence suggests that
sleep may be an important mediator linking care stressors with mental health.
Factors such as mindfulness and sense of coherence may protect caregivers from
sleep disturbances.

Preserving health requires a holistic approach involving the component of
physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being as stated by World Health
Organisation. Salutogenesis concept focuses on the factors responsible for
well-being rather than the disease pathogenesis in contrary to pathogenesis
concept. This evidence-based summary tries to shed a light on existing concept
called salutogenesis which is much required in the current scenario.

Borderline personality disorder is a clinically important psychiatric diagnosis
that is distinct from major depressive, bipolar and posttraumatic stress
disorders, despite the overlapping symptoms. The diagnosis is mainly clinical and
must follow the DMS 5 (or ICD 10) characteristics. The most common age at first
presentation is in late adolescence, but the disorder frequently can be stay as
misdiagnosed. Our study is concerned to QEEG characteristics, as well as
coherence in borderline patients compared with healthy group, matched by number, 
gender and age and selected randomly. Our obtained results showed that
electrophysiological characteristics for borderlines are fairly without
statistical differences, except in low bands (delta and theta), which showed
significantly lower frequencies and coherence compared to a healthy group. Future
research in this filed with more patients is highly recommended.

In July 2013, a train carrying crude oil derailed in Lac-Mégantic (Canada). This 
disaster provoked a major fire, 47 deaths, the destruction of 44 buildings, a
massive evacuation, and an unparalleled oil spill. Since 2013, Public Health has 
undertaken several actions to address this challenging situation, using both
quantitative and qualitative methods. Community-based surveys were conducted in
Lac-Mégantic in 2014, 2015 and 2018. The first two surveys showed persistent and 
widespread health needs. Inspired by a salutogenic approach, Public Health has
shifted its focus from health protection to health promotion. In 2016, a Day of
Reflection was organized during which a map of community assets and an action
plan for the community recovery were co-constructed with local stakeholders. The 
creation of an Outreach Team is an important outcome of this collective
reflection. This team aims to enhance resilience and adaptive capacity. Several
promising initiatives arose from the action plan-all of which greatly contributed
to mobilize the community. Interestingly, the 2018 survey suggests that the
situation is now evolving positively. This case study stresses the importance of 
recognizing community members as assets, rather than victims, and seeking a
better balance between health protection and health promotion approaches.

Health benefits of blue spaces have been less studied compared with other urban
natural environments. As a type of blue space, beaches are also affected by this 
lack of evidence, despite their cultural and economic importance in lots of
coastal regions all over the world. Based on secondary health data from 3192
participants of the Health Survey of Barcelona 2016, we conducted a logit
regression analysis to explore the relationship between people's general health
and beach proximity from their dwelling place, controlling for several health
determinants. Our main results suggested that having good general health was less
likely for a 1-km increase in the linear distance to the closest beach from
people's dwelling places (OR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.87, 1.00). Moreover, the
probability of having good general health was 45% higher for people living in the
first 2 km from the beach (OR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.01, 2.09), relative to those
living >5-10 km from it. Also, these health effects were stronger for people with
a low family income. These findings contribute to grow the currently small body
of research related to health benefits of beach spaces. Likewise, they encourage 
fostering the use of these spaces for health promotion in cities, as well as
protecting them and improving their accessibility and safety. Further research
should lean towards the underlying causes of these health benefits linked to
people's exposure to beach spaces.

PURPOSE: The association of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) severity
and related health status with sleep quality remains unclear. We aimed to
investigate the association between COPD and sleep quality in the Greek national 
branch of the UNLOCK cohort.
METHODS: A sample of 257 COPD patients enrolled cross-sectionally from primary
care in Greece. Sleep quality was assessed by the COPD and Asthma Sleep Impact
Scale (CASIS-7 items) questionnaire (higher score indicates worse sleep quality).
We tested for associations of sleep impairment with health status (CAT and mMRC
scores), exacerbations, hospitalizations, GOLD 2018 ABCD status, inhaler
adherence, frailty, and sense of coherence, adjusting for age, gender, smoking
status, and comorbidities.
RESULTS: The majority of patients reported uncontrolled symptoms (91% with ≥ 10
CAT or 61% with ≥ 2 mMRC). Mean (SD) age was 65 (12.3) with 79% males. CASIS-7
mean (SD) score was 37.7 (12.9). After adjustments, CASIS was significantly
associated with worse health status (e.g., CASIS increased with CAT ≥ 10
[β = 12.53, (95% CI, 6.82, 18.25); p < 0.001], mMRC ≥ 2 [β = 4.96, (95% CI, 1.56,
8.34); p = 0.004]), COPD severity (CAT-based GOLD BD [β = 8.88 (95% CI, 2.50,
15.26); p = 0.007]), frailty [β = 8.85 (95% CI 4.45,13.25); p < 0.001], and sense
of coherence [β = -0.14 (95% CI -0.21, -0.06), p < 001]. When using a CASIS
cut-off score of 30 as indicator of sleep impairment, additional to the
aforementioned associations, we found increased risk for sleep impairment with
≥ 2 exacerbations/year and poor inhaler adherence (p value < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that worse health status and COPD severity are
associated with poor sleep quality in COPD patients.

OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between suicidal ideation and sexual and
physical abuse among active and recently retired elite athletics (track and
field) athletes.
METHODS: The study population consisted of all athletes (n=402) selected for a
Swedish Athletics team between 2011 and 2017. Data on suicidal ideation, suicidal
events (estimated through the 1 year non-sports injury prevalence), lifetime
abuse experiences, sociodemographics, sense of coherence and coping strategies
were collected using a cross-sectional survey. The data were analysed using
binary logistic regression with suicidal ideation and non-sports injury as
outcomes.
RESULTS: 192 athletes (47.8%) returned data. The prevalence of suicidal ideation 
was 15.6% (men 17.4%; women 14.2%) and the non-sports injury prevalence was 8.0% 
(men 11.6%; women 5.7%). Among women, suicidal ideation was associated with
having been sexually abused (OR 5.94, 95% CI 1.42 to 24.90; p=0.015) and lower
sense of coherence (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.96; p=0.001) (Nagelkerke R2=0.33). 
Among men, suicidal ideation was only associated with use of behavioural
disengagement for coping (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.95; p=0.001) (R2 =0.25).
Among women, non-sports injury prevalence was associated with having been
sexually abused (OR 8.61, 95% CI 1.34 to 55.1; p=0.023) and participating in an
endurance event (OR 7.37, 95% CI 1.11 to 48.9; p=0.039 (R2 =0.23), while among
men, having immigrant parents (OR 5.67, 95% CI 1.31 to 24.5; p=0.020) (R2 =0.11) 
was associated with injury outside sports.
CONCLUSIONS: About one out of six international athletics athletes reported
having experienced suicidal ideation. World Athletics and National Olympic
Committees need to include suicide prevention in their athlete protection
programmes.

Glaucoma is a group of optic neuropathies characterized by a progressive
degeneration of retina ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons that precedes
functional changes detected on the visual field. The macular ganglion cell
complex (GCC), available in commercial Fourier-domain optical coherence
tomography, allows the quantification of the innermost retinal layers that are
potentially involved in the glaucomatous damage, including the retinal nerve
fiber (RNFL), ganglion cell and inner plexiform layers. The average GCC thickness
and its related parameters represent a reliable biomarker in detecting
preperimetric glaucomatous damage. The most accurate GCC parameters are
represented by average and inferior GCC thicknesses, and they can be associated
with progressive visual field loss. Although the diagnostic accuracy increases
with more severe glaucomatous damage and higher signal strength values, it is not
affected by increasing axial length, resulting in a more accurate discrimination 
of glaucomatous damage in myopic eyes with respect to the traditional RNFL
thickness. The analysis of the structure-function relationship revealed a good
agreement between the loss in retinal sensitivity and GCC thickness. The use of a
10-2° visual field grid, adjusted for the anatomical RGCs displacement, describes
more accurately the relationship between RGCs thickness and visual field
sensitivity loss.

The aim of our review is to identify the key job resources and demands of nursing
staff by integrating findings from previously published reviews along the lines
of the JD-R model. Understanding these is highly relevant given the
ever-increasing pressure in nursing work and the challenges of healthcare
organizations in recruiting qualified staff. It is also an important step toward 
developing targeted workplace interventions. A comprehensive search of the
literature identified 14 quantitative and qualitative reviews that were included 
in our integrative review of reviews. Thematic analysis identified three key job 
demands and six key job resources of nursing staff, namely work overload, lack of
formal rewards, work-life interference, supervisor support, fair and authentic
management, transformational leadership, interpersonal relations, autonomy and
professional resources. Our results corroborate findings from previous reviews,
expand the relevance and generalizability by considering a broader range of
relevant health-related and motivational outcomes, and highlight the importance
of leadership practices in nursing.

The prevalence of energy drink consumption has increased in Hungary over the past
10-15 years. This study assesses the frequency, motivations, and adverse effects 
of energy drink consumption, and examines how the process of becoming a regular
consumer is connected with sense of coherence and depression symptoms. A total of
631 high school and college students were assessed using the Depression Scale
(BDS-13) and Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-13). Logistic regression models were
fit to test the effect of and links between factors influencing addiction to
energy drink use. A total of 31.1% (95% CI: 27.4-34.7) of those surveyed consumed
energy drinks, 24.0% of those affected consumed the energy drink with alcohol,
71.4% (95% CI: 64.7-77.3) experienced adverse effects following energy drink
consumption, and 10.2% (95% CI: 6.7-15.2) experienced at least four symptoms
simultaneously. The most common motivations of consumption were fatigue, taste,
and fun. Obtained by multivariate logistic regression models, after adjustment
for sex and age, SOC and tendency to depression had a significant influence on
the respondents' odds of addiction. The tendency to depression increases the
chances of addiction, while a strong sense of coherence diminishes the effects of
depression. Young people in Hungary have been shown to consume energy drinks in
quantities that are detrimental to their health. Complex preventive measures and 
programs are needed to address the problem. Families and educators should strive 
to instill a strong sense of coherence in children from an early age.

Background: The health behaviors smoking, risky alcohol consumption, insufficient
physical activity, and poor diet constitute the main contributors to
non-communicable diseases. Clustering of risk behaviors is common and increases
the risk of these diseases. Despite health benefits, it is difficult to change
health behaviors. Psychosocial factors could play a role in health behavior
change, with research showing relationships between unfavorable psychosocial
factors and health risk behaviors. However, many studies only investigated one or
two health behaviors at a time. The present study, therefore, aimed to
investigate associations between a broad range of psychosocial factors and
multiple health risk behaviors in a general middle-aged population in Sweden.
Methods: A cross-sectional design was used to investigate a random sample from
the general population in Sweden (n = 1007, 45-69 years, 50% women).
Questionnaire data on health behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical
activity, and fruit/vegetable intake) and psychosocial factors, with both
psychological and social resources (social integration, emotional support,
perceived control, self-esteem, sense of coherence and trust) and psychological
risk factors (cynicism, vital exhaustion, hopelessness and depressiveness), were 
analyzed. Logistic and ordinal logistic regression were used to analyze
associations between psychosocial factors and multiple (0-1, 2 or 3-4) health
risk behaviors. Results: A total of 50% of the sample had two health risk
behaviors and 18% had three health risk behaviors. After adjusting for age, sex, 
education, employment status, and immigrant status, eight out of 10 psychosocial 
factors (exceptions: social integration and self-esteem) showed significant odds 
ratios (ORs) in the expected directions; low levels of psychosocial resources and
high levels of psychosocial risk factors were associated with multiple risk
behaviors. The strongest associations with multiple risk behaviors were seen for 
vital exhaustion (adjusted (adj.) OR 1.28; confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.46),
depressiveness (adj. OR 1.32, CI 1.14-1.52), and trust (adj. OR 0.80, CI
0.70-0.91). When controlling for all psychosocial factors in the same model, only
the association with trust remained statistically significant (adj. OR 0.89, CI
0.73-1.00, p = 0.050). Associations with individual health behaviors were fewer
and scattered, with no psychosocial factor being related to all four behaviors.
Conclusions: Examining associations between a broad range of psychosocial factors
and multiple health risk behaviors revealed consistent and significant
associations for almost all psychosocial factors. These associations were
stronger compared to associations to single health risk behaviors. Our findings
support the relevance of considering psychosocial aspects in interventions aimed 
at health behavior change, especially for people with multiple health risk
behaviors.

Achieving healthy ageing through the perspective of sense of coherence among
senior-only households: a qualitative study.

Sciences, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.

Objectives: Explore perceptions towards healthy ageing through the perspective of
sense of coherence among older adults residing in senior-only households.Methods:
A qualitative study using focus group interviews was conducted and appreciative
inquiry was adopted as a strengths-based interviewing approach. 27 older adults
who either live alone or with their spouses only were involved in six focus group
discussions at a community centre in Singapore. Data saturation was achieved and 
thematic analysis was performed to analyse the data.Results: The four emerging
themes were (1) contending evolving vulnerabilities, (2) intrinsic value of
health, (3) taking care of oneself is a personal responsibility, and (4) taking
one day at a time: outlook towards later part of life. Older adults' underlying
pathogenic orientation towards health contributed to their perceived
unpredictable confrontations with vicissitudes including illness and death. This 
played a part to their short outlook towards old age. Consequently, this could
limit their will and abilities to seek meaningful pursuits or valued aspirations 
and movement towards the salutogenic health pole.Conclusion: By reframing the
definition of health to pursuing and fulfilling valued accomplishments, optimal
health can be achieved regardless of physical health state. This study suggested 
that sense of coherence towards the pursuit of healthy ageing can be addressed by
reducing the unpredictability of ageing-related processes and vulnerabilities
(comprehensibility), supporting active adoption of actions which promotes
physical, mental and social health (manageability) and individual reflection in
making sense of old age to seek motivation in living each day purposefully
(meaningfulness).

The medicalization of cancer as socially constructed and culturally negotiated.

Fries CJ(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Sociology and Criminology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg,
Manitoba, Canada R3T 2N2.

Sociological considerations of medicalization frequently employ a limited use of 
the term that focuses on the transformation of social phenomena into issues
subject to medical control. Informed by a salutogenic perspective, this essay
argues that it is possible to understand cancer as having been medicalized. I
show that far from exclusively a biophysical issue, the medicalization of cancer 
is a socially constructed and culturally negotiated process, with a fairly recent
historical origin. While changing social relations of healing have led our
medico-centric culture to a near single-minded understanding of cancer as a
cellular pathology rooted in biology, Antonovsky's salutogenic perspective
instructs that it is possible to understand and control cancer in non-medicalized
ways. Indoor radon gas remediation is presented as an illustration of what form
salutary cancer control and disease prevention may take.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization has highlighted the importance of
health promotion for health service providers in order to ensure sustainable
working life for individuals involved in providing health services. Such
sustainability begins when students are preparing to manage their own future
health and welfare in working life. It has been suggested that universities,
employees and trainee health professionals should adopt or follow a salutogenic
approach that not only complements the providing of information on known health
risks but also favors health promotion strategies. This paper describes the study
design and data collection methods in a planned study aiming to explore
health-promoting factors for a sustainable working life among students in higher 
education within healthcare and social work.
METHODS: This protocol describes a multicenter longitudinal study involving
Swedish students on higher education programs in the healthcare and social work
sectors. In 2018, the study invited students on seven education programs at six
universities to participate. These programs were for qualification as: biomedical
laboratory scientists (n = 121); dental hygienists (n = 87); nurses (n = 1411);
occupational therapists (n = 111); physiotherapists (n = 48); radiographers
(n = 60); and, social workers (n = 443). In total, 2283 students were invited to 
participate. Participants completed a baseline, a self-reported questionnaire
including six validated instruments measuring health-promoting factors and
processes. There are to be five follow-up questionnaires. Three while the
students are studying, one a year after graduating, and one three years after
graduating. Each questionnaire captures different health-promoting dimensions,
namely: health-promoting resources (i.e. sense of coherence); occupational
balance; emotional intelligence; health and welfare; social interaction; and work
and workplace experiences/perceptions.
DISCUSSION: This study focuses on the vastly important aspect of promoting a
sustainable working life for healthcare and social work employees. In contrast to
previous studies in this area, the present study uses different, validated
instruments in health promotion, taking a salutogenic approach. It is hoped that,
by stimulating the implementation of new strategies, the study's findings will
lead to education programs that prepare students better for a sustainable working
life in healthcare and social work.

Mystical and Other Alterations in Sense of Self: An Expanded Framework for
Studying Nonordinary Experiences.

Taves A(1).

Although many researchers in psychology, religious studies, and psychiatry
recognize that there is overlap in the experiences their subjects recount,
disciplinary silos and challenges involved in comparing reported experiences have
left us with little understanding of the mechanisms, whether biological,
psychological, and/or sociocultural, through which these experiences are
represented and differentiated. So-called mystical experiences, which some
psychologists view as potentially sui generis, provide a test case for assessing 
whether we can develop an expanded framework for studying unusual experiences
across disciplines and cultures. Evidence for the special nature of "mystical
experience" rests on the operationalization of a metaphysically untestable
construct in two widely used self-report scales: the Mysticism Scale and the
Mystical Experiences Questionnaire. Consideration of the construct in light of
research on alterations in sense of self induced by psychoactive drugs and
meditation practices suggests that "positive experiences of undifferentiated
unity" are not sui generis, but rather a type of "ego dissolution." To better
understand the nature and effects of unusual experiences, such as alterations in 
the sense of self, we need self-report measures that distinguish between
generically worded experiences and the way they are appraised in terms of
valence, significance, cause, and long-term effects in different contexts.

The sense of coherence (SOC) is a measure of global orientation regarding the
ability of individuals to cope with stressful situations. The aim of the present 
study was to evaluate the association between SOC and quality of life (QoL) and
clinical and sociodemographic characteristics among survivors of oral,
oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx cancer. A cross-sectional study was conducted 
with 90 cancer patients in follow up at the Santa Maria University Hospital in
southern Brazil who had completed conformal 3D radiotherapy at least three months
earlier. QoL was assessed using the University of Washington Quality of Life
(UW-QOL) questionnaire and SOC was measured using the Brazilian version of the
SOC-13 questionnaire. Data on socio-demographic characteristics and the disease
were obtained from patients' charts. Oral clinical conditions were also
evaluated. Associations between exploratory variables and mean UW-QOL scores were
evaluated through Poisson regression and the results were presented as rate
ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The mean overall UW-QOL score was 
67.90 (± 18.71). Moderate and high SOC scores were associated with higher mean
UW-QOL scores, that is, individuals with a stronger SOC demonstrated better QoL, 
(p < 0.05). Regarding the clinical variables, individuals with advanced stage
cancer and those with hyposalivation and trismus had poorer QoL (p < 0.05).
Patients with a greater SOC reported a better quality of life. Our findings show 
the importance of focusing on psychosocial factors, which can alleviate the
impact caused by the disease and improve the QoL of these patients.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore whether population characteristics were
associated with the use of dental services, individual's personal oral health
practices, dental caries and oral health-related impacts using the revised
Andersen's behavioural model as the theoretical framework.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included participants from a Norwegian
general population (N = 1840; 20-79 years) included in the Tromstannen-Oral
Health in Northern Norway (TOHNN) study. The variables included in the model were
social structure (income, education, urbanization), sense of coherence (SOC),
enabling resources (difficulties accessing the dentist, declined treatment,
dental anxiety), treatment need, use of dental services, toothbrushing frequency,
sugary soda drink consumption, decayed teeth and oral health-related impacts
(OHIP-14). Structural equation modelling was used to test the direct and indirect
effects within Andersen's behavioural model of access and health outcomes.
RESULTS: Andersen's behavioural model fit the data well and explained a large
part of the variance in use of dental services (58%), oral health-related impacts
(48%) and, to a lesser extent, decayed teeth (12%). More social structures and a 
stronger SOC was associated with more enabling resources, which in turn, was
associated with more use of dental services. Social structures were not directly 
associated with use of dental services or decayed teeth but were predictive of
oral health-related impacts. A stronger SOC was associated with more frequent
toothbrushing, less soda drink consumptions, fewer decayed teeth and less oral
health-related impacts. Self-perceived need did not predict dental attendance but
was associated with decayed teeth. A less frequent use of dental services, less
frequent toothbrushing and more frequent sugary soda drink consumption were
associated with more decayed teeth. Decayed teeth were not associated with oral
health-related impacts.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggests that, in addition to focusing on reducing
socioeconomic inequalities in relation to oral health in the Norwegian
population, it is also important to consider how people perceive their own
resources (eg financial, psychological, social) as well as their access to dental
care in order to support regular dental attendance and potentially, in turn,
enhance oral health.

The Barcelona Brain Health Initiative is a longitudinal cohort study that began
in 2017 and aims to understand and characterize the determinants of brain health 
maintenance in middle aged adults. A cohort of 4686 individuals between the ages 
of 40 and 65 years free from any neurological or psychiatric diseases was
established, and we collected extensive demographic, socio-economic information
along with measures of self-perceived health and lifestyles (general health,
physical activity, cognitive activity, socialization, sleep, nutrition and vital 
plan). Here we report on the baseline characteristics of the participants, and
the results of the one-year follow-up evaluation. Participants were mainly women,
highly educated, and with better lifestyles compared with the general population.
After one year 60% of participants completed the one-year follow-up, and these
were older, with higher educational level and with better lifestyles in some
domains. In the absence of any specific interventions to-date, these participants
showed small improvements in physical activity and sleep, but decreased adherence
to a Mediterranean diet. These changes were negatively associated with baseline
scores, and poorer habits at baseline were predictive of an improvement in
lifestyle domains. Of the 2353 participants who completed the one-year follow-up,
73 had been diagnosed with new neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases.
Changes in vital plan at follow-up, as well as gender, sleep quality and sense of
coherence at baseline were shown to be significant risk factors for the onset of 
these diagnoses. Notably, gender risk factor decreased in importance as we
adjusted by sleep habits, suggesting its potential mediator effects. These
findings stress the importance of healthy lifestyles in sustaining brain health, 
and illustrate the individual benefit that can be derived from participation in
longitudinal observational studies. Modifiable lifestyles, specifically quality
of sleep, may partially mediate the effect of other risk factors in the
development of some neuropsychiatric conditions.

Purpose: To describe the clinical characteristics and visual prognosis of ocular 
involvement in syphilis.Design: A retrospective cohort study.Methods: We studied 
the charts of 24 patients who visited our Ophthalmological Centre in Rome, Italy.
All patients with serological evidence of syphilitic infection were
included.Results: Ocular involvement was the first manifestation of syphilitic
disease in 96% and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) seropositivity was found in
29% of the cases. The most frequent ocular manifestation was posterior uveitis.
Vitreous involvement was frequent. Patients with papillitis at onset showed
better visual outcome with antisyphilitic treatment. Posterior uveitis at onset
and HIV seropositivity were negative prognostic factors for visual outcome.
HIV-positive patients showed more severe and frequent bilateral course of ocular 
involvement in syphilis.Conclusions: The ophthalmologist should suspect syphilis 
in patien ts with uveitis or optic neuropathy associated with high-risk sexual
behaviour and/or HIV, or in patients with posterior placoid chorioretinitis,
necrotising retinitis, or interstitial keratitis.

Development and Testing of the Preparation for Labor and Birth Instrument.

Neerland CE, Avery MD, Looman WS, Saftner MA, Rockwood TH, Gurvich OV.

OBJECTIVE: To develop and assess the reliability and validity of a new instrument
used during the third trimester of pregnancy to measure women's confidence in
their ability to achieve physiologic birth, the Preparation for Labor and Birth
(P-LAB) instrument.
DESIGN: Two-phase instrument development study that consisted of item generation 
and a prospective field test.
SETTING: Field testing occurred in five midwestern U.S. prenatal clinics.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants in the field test were 203 nulliparous and parous
pregnant women who intended to give birth vaginally.
METHODS: Psychometric testing consisted of test-retest reliability testing and
assessments of content validity, face validity, and construct validity. We
measured construct validity using exploratory factor analysis and correlation
with the Sense of Coherence Scale.
RESULTS: The 22-item P-LAB showed good content validity, good internal
consistency, and stability over time. All items had content validity index scores
greater than or equal to 0.8, and the total instrument content validity index was
0.95. We identified four factors related to women's confidence in their ability
to achieve physiologic birth: Planned Use of Pain Medication, Relationship With
Care Provider and Supportive Birth Environment, Beliefs About Labor, and Labor
Support (social and professional). Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the four
extracted factors were .93, .76, .73 and .74, respectively. Intraclass
correlation [95% confidence interval] for the total questionnaire was .92 [.88,
.94]. We found no linear association between total P-LAB scores and sense of
coherence.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate acceptable initial psychometric properties
for the P-LAB instrument. Additional testing is required to evaluate the
instrument's construct, convergent, and divergent validity.

Keep your interoceptive streams under control: An active inference perspective on
anorexia nervosa.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychiatric disorder primarily characterized by
"restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to a significantly
low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and
physical health" (DSM-5, n.d.). Here, we propose a novel interpretation of food
restriction of AN, which elaborates on recent accounts of the brain as a
predictive machine, continuously inferring and controling incoming signals,
including bodily signals - i.e., interoceptive (active) inference. In this
perspective, the extreme eating restrictions characterizing AN may serve the
fundamental role of keeping under control (i.e., reducing excessively high levels
of) interoceptive uncertainty, above and beyond controlling and mitigating
concerns for body weight. In other words, noisy interoceptive streams may
instantiate active strategies (i.e., eating restrictions) that amplify autonomic 
hunger signals, to minimize interoceptive uncertainty and maintain a more
coherent sense of (interoceptive) self.

Author information: 
(1)Mental Health Research and Treatment Center, Faculty of Psychology,
Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Bochum, Germany.

Background/Objective: Protective factors are relevant for mental health in
general, however, universality of the instruments has been rarely tested.
Therefore, the current study aimed to examine psychometric properties and
cross-cultural measurement invariance of salutogenic constructs.
Method: Data was collected from university students of Pakistan (n = 1,841) and
Germany (n = 7,890). Single-group confirmatory analysis (CFA) and multiple-group 
CFA was tested to examine the proposed factor structure and measurement
invariance of Positive Mental Health Scale, Resilience Scale, Perceived Social
Support Questionnaire, and Life Satisfaction Scale across student samples from
Pakistan and Germany respectively.
Results: We found strong measurement invariance for the Positive Mental Health
Scale, Life Satisfaction Scale, and partial strong measurement for the Resilience
Scale, and Perceived Social Support Questionnaire.
Conclusions: The results indicate that these scales could be recommended for the 
meaningful comparison of latent means across cultures. Understanding these
differences would further advance our knowledge about the mechanism underlying
positive mental health.

Barriers to Quality of Care for Cancer Patients in Rural Areas: A Study from the 
Faroe Islands.

Introduction: Research has indicated that cancer patients living in rural areas
receive poorer quality of treatment and care than their urban counterparts. With 
a population of approximately 51,000, the Faroe Islands may be characterized as a
small-scale, rural society. Due to the geographical location and size of the
Faroe Islands, patients who live there often receive part of their treatment
abroad. Although a shift in the focus of cancer care from a disease-focused
approach to a person-centered approach has been successfully implemented
elsewhere, legal and structural conditions unique to the Faroe Islands might
prohibit the realization of this paradigmatic shift in the Faroe Islands. The aim
of this qualitative study was to examine how Faroese cancer patients have
experienced their disease, treatment, and care and provide additional knowledge
on cancer patients living in small-scale and rural societies.
Methods: Five men and three women who had been through a cancer treatment course 
with a good prognosis volunteered to be interviewed. Their ages varied from 40 to
80 years. "Active interviewing", a constructionist approach to qualitative
interviewing and latent thematic analysis, was applied.
Results: Three overlapping themes were identified from the categories: sense of
coherence, resources and challenges in everyday life, and trust in the system.
The analysis uncovered multiple factors related to legal and structural
conditions that were barriers to ensuring the quality of cancer care for
patients, for instance, shifting consultants, a lack of coherence in treatment,
information loss and insufficient contact with cancer nurse specialists.
Discussion: This study is based on a limited number of participants. However, the
findings from this study provide insight into the special conditions of cancer
patients living in a small-scale, rural society and help explain disparities in
the quality of cancer treatment and care between urban and rural areas.

Objective: This study aimed to examine the relationship between mortality risk
and health-related factors and sense of coherence (SOC) in a cohort study of
residents from a rural area of Japan. Materials and Methods: We followed-up with 
3,416 baseline respondents over 3.76 years. Residents were subdivided into three 
groups based on SOC score: low, middle, and high. We used the total SOC score of 
the low-level SOC group as the standard, and calculated the standardized
mortality ratio (SMR) for the middle- and high-level SOC groups. For all three
SOC groups, health-related factors were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance,
and lifestyle and history were analyzed using the χ2 test. Results were also
analyzed by gender and age. Results: For men in the low-level SOC group, the SMR 
value was defined as 1, and for men in the high-level SOC group (0.44; 95%
confidence interval: 0.11-0.77), the SMR value was significantly lower. There was
a statistically significant reduction in the percentage of smokers in the men in 
the high-level SOC group. Conclusion: In this study, high-level SOC was
associated with low mortality risk. This finding was particularly pronounced in
the men.

Between Kepler and Newton: Hooke's 'principles of congruity and incongruity' and 
the naturalization of mathematics.

Gal O(1), Hodoba Eric C(1).

Australia.

Robert Hooke's development of the theory of matter-as-vibration provides
coherence to a career in natural philosophy which is commonly perceived as
scattered and haphazard. It also highlights aspects of his work for which he is
rarely credited: besides the creative speculative imagination and
practical-instrumental ingenuity for which he is known, it displays lucid and
consistent theoretical thought and mathematical skills. Most generally and
importantly, however, Hooke's 'Principles … of Congruity and Incongruity of
bodies' represent a uniquely powerful approach to the most pressing challenge of 
the New Science: legitimizing the application of mathematics to the study of
nature. This challenge required reshaping the mathematical practices and
procedures; an epistemological framework supporting these practices; and a
metaphysics which could make sense of this epistemology. Hooke's 'Uniform
Geometrical or Mechanical Method' was a bold attempt to answer the three
challenges together, by interweaving mathematics through physics into metaphysics
and epistemology. Mathematics, in his rendition, was neither an abstract and
ideal structure (as it was for Kepler), nor a wholly-flexible, artificial human
tool (as it was for Newton). It drew its power from being contingent on the
particularities of the material world.

BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents in foster care show a high prevalence of
cumulative traumatic experiences (CTE), symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) and symptoms related to disturbances in self-organization (DSO). PTSD and 
DSO constitute the ICD-11 diagnosis Complex PTSD (CPTSD). Sense of coherence
(SOC) has been shown to alleviate the impact of CTE.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the mediating role of SOC in the
relationship between CTE, PTSD, and DSO.
PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Trauma history (CTE), PTSD, DSO and SOC were assessed
in a sample of 140 children and adolescents in foster care aged 10-18 using
self-report questionnaires.
METHOD: Mediation analysis determined the direct, indirect and total effect of
the mediation of SOC in the relationship between CTE, PTSD and DSO.
RESULTS: The results showed no mediation of SOC in the relationship between CTE
and PTSD symptoms (indirect effect of b = -.001, 95 %CI: -.088-.086). However,
SOC mediated the relationship between CTE and DSO symptoms (indirect effect b =
.128, 95 %CI: 0.045-.211).
CONCLUSIONS: Those results may point to a promotive function of SOC for the
overall development and different areas of self-organization, but not for PTSD
symptoms. It is possible that the influence of the trauma on symptoms of PTSD is 
too pervasive for the promotive function of SOC. The present findings strengthen 
the assumption that PTSD and DSO are separate second-order factors, which
characterize different groups of trauma survivors. The present findings are vital
to inform tailored prevention and intervention strategies for survivors of early 
CTE.

OBJECTIVE: To identify subgroups of women who differ with respect to
self-evaluated stress, hostility, optimism and sense of coherence, and to
identify differences, if any, in whether these subgroups use or do not use
hormone replacement therapy (HT).
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This time-trend study is based on the Finnish national 
HeSSup study, in which nationwide cohorts of Finnish women aged 52-56 years
randomly selected in 2000 (n = 1321) and in 2010 (n = 1389) responded to postal
questionnaires related to four psychological behavior patterns.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relationships between psychological behavior patterns
(stress, hostility, optimism and sense of coherence) and how menopausal symptoms 
are experienced and how this relates to the use of HT.
RESULTS: The proportion of HT users was higher among those with more stress and
hostility and less optimism and sense of coherence than among those low in stress
and hostility and high in optimism and sense of coherence.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in psychological behavior patterns influence the
perception of menopausal symptoms and the use of HT. When the treatment of women 
at menopause is planned, psychological behavior patterns should be considered, as
these reflect the ability to cope with menopausal symptoms.

Defining 'Integration' for Total Worker Health®: A New Proposal.

The effects of work and the conditions of employment on health behaviors and
intermediate health conditions have been demonstrated, to the extent that these
relationships should be addressed in efforts to prevent chronic disease. However,
conventional health promotion practice generally focuses on personal risk factors
and individual behavior change. In an effort to find solutions to the myriad of
health challenges faced by the American workforce, the U.S. National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) established the Total Worker Health®
(TWH) program. Originally organized around the paradigm of integrating
traditional occupational safety and health protections with workplace health
promotion, TWH has evolved to a broader emphasis on workplace programs for
enhancing worker safety, health, and well-being. Among the research programs and 
approaches developed by investigators at NIOSH Centers of Excellence for TWH and 
elsewhere, definitions of 'integration' in workplace interventions vary widely.
There is no consensus about which organizational or individual outcomes are the
most salient, how much to emphasize organizational contexts of work, or which
program elements are necessary in order to qualify as 'Total Worker Health'.
Agreement about the dimensions of integration would facilitate comparison of
programs and interventions which are self-defined as TWH, although diverse in
content. The specific criteria needed to define integration should be unique to
that concept-i.e. distinct from and additive to conventional criteria for
predicting or evaluating the success of a workplace health program. We propose a 
set of four TWH-specific metrics for integrated interventions that address both
program content and process: (i) coordination and interaction of workplace
programs across domains; (ii) assessment of both work and non-work exposures;
(iii) emphasis on interventions to make the workplace more health-promoting; and 
(iv) participatory engagement of workers in pivotal ways during intervention
prioritization and planning to develop self-efficacy in addressing root causes,
skill transfer, building program ownership, empowerment, and continuous
improvement. Thus we find that integration requires organizational change, both
to engage two managerial functions with different goals, legal responsibilities, 
and (often) internal incentives & resources, and also to orient the organization 
toward salutogenesis. Examples from research activity within the Center for the
Promotion of Health in the New England Workplace illustrate how these criteria
have been applied in practice.

Anxiety Disorders and the Brain's Resting State Networks: From Altered
Spatiotemporal Synchronization to Psychopathological Symptoms.

Anxiety disorders include a variety of different disorders including panic
disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD),
and phobias. We here focus our review on GAD, SAD, and PD and put a specific
emphasis on resting state networks and the coupling between the brain and the
heart as all anxiety disorders exhibit abnormal perception of their own heartbeat
in some way or the other. Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) studies
demonstrate abnormalities in default-mode network (DMN) in all anxiety disorders,
e.g., mostly decreases in rsFC of DMN. In contrast, resting state fMRI shows
increased rsFC in salience network (SN) (SAD, GAD) and/or somato-motor/sensory
network (SMN) (PD). Since rsFC is coherence- or phase-based operating in the
infraslow frequency domain (0.01-0.1 Hz), these data suggest spatiotemporal hypo-
or hyper-synchronization in DMN and SMN/SN, respectively. These abnormalities in 
the neural network's spatiotemporal synchronization may, in turn, impact
phase-based temporal synchronization of neural and cardiac activities resulting
in decreased (DMN) or increased (SMN/SN) neuro-cardiac coupling in anxiety
disorders. That, in turn, may be related to the various psychopathological
symptoms like unstable sense of self (as based on unstable DMN showing
spatiotemporal hypo-synchronization), increased emotions and specifically anxiety
(as related to increased SN showing spatiotemporal hyper-synchronization), and
increased bodily awareness (mediated by increased SMN with spatiotemporal
hyper-synchronization) in anxiety disorders. Taken together, we here suggest
altered spatiotemporal synchronization of neural and cardiac activity within the 
brain's resting state to underlie various psychopathological symptoms in anxiety 
disorders. Such spatiotemporal basis of psychopathological symptoms is well
compatible with the recently suggested "Spatiotemporal Psychopathology."

INTRODUCTION: Antonovsky's sense of coherence (SOC) has been shown to positively 
correlate with quality of life (QoL). We examined the relationship between
socio-demographic data and clinical covariates along with various QoL domains to 
SOC in patients presenting for care within a chiropractic practice-based research
network.
METHODS: In addition to providing socio-demographic information and clinical
covariates, patients attending care within a PBRN completed the PROMIS-29 and
PROMIS global health to measure of QoL and SOC-29 to measure SOC at baseline. In 
addition to descriptive statistics, we utilized a random forest analysis to
assess the predictively ability of covariates to SOC.
RESULTS: Our dataset was comprised of a convenience sample of 1980 responders
(average age = 40.72 years; 1494 females and 486 males). The mean T scores
(T1/T2) for the various QoL domains physical functioning (50.97), anxiety
(52.03), depression (47.47), fatigue (51.15), ability to participate in social
roles and activities (54.44), sleep disturbance (59.85), pain interference
(51.27), global physical health (GPH) (49.34) and global mental health (GMH)
(50.69). Mean pain intensity rating was 4.23. The mean SOC-29 was 148.34. The
most important covariates to changes in SOC were: GPH, depression, anxiety age,
fatigue and sleep disturbance. Partial dependence plots revealed that increasing 
GPH, GMH and age of patient predict increasing SOC. A high SOC was predicted in
the presence of low GPH given a high GMH scoring.
CONCLUSIONS: The mental health QoL domains had a stronger predictability for SOC 
than physical health domains.

Having 2 or more relatives involved in the informal care of people with dementia 
is frequent worldwide. There are, however, few comparisons of primary and
secondary caregivers and even fewer of those who are caring for the same person. 
Our study aimed to contrast these 2 experiences of caregiving. We compared 2
related samples of 61 primary and 61 secondary family caregivers of the same
persons with dementia in a nonrandomized cross-sectional study. Caregivers' main 
outcome assessments were the Zarit Burden Interview (for subjective burden), the 
General Health Questionnaire (for psychological distress), and the Positive
Aspects of Caregiving scale. We controlled for caregiver variables (e.g.,
demographics, caregiving arrangements, social support, sense of coherence) and
the neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. Subjective burden was higher in
primary than secondary caregivers (p = .013), but positive aspects of caregiving 
did not differ (p = .150). Psychological distress was high at clinically relevant
levels in primary and secondary caregivers, without statistically significant
differences between groups (p = .456). The findings demonstrate that
notwithstanding the difficulties faced by primary caregivers, secondary
caregivers may also experience clinically significant distress. Therefore, their 
needs for assistance and support should be addressed more systematically. These
findings call for systemic family-focused interventions in dementia that address 
the support each person provides or might provide, as well as the psychological
distress each person may feel. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights

OBJECTIVE: Around 700,000 Syrian refugees live in Germany, most of them having
come alone since 2015 as asylum seekers and waiting in Germany for family
reunification. This study focused on separation from marital partner and its
impact on quality of life among Syrian refugees with a residence permit.
METHODS: For the present investigation, we included only married participants of 
a larger registry-based study. Therefore, we analyzed 119 participants; 93 of
them were married, and their partner accompanied them in Germany at the time of
the investigation (partner+), while a further 26 were married but separated from 
their partner (partner-). The respondents were investigated for mental stress,
quality of life and protective factors.
RESULTS: The partner- group reported significantly lower quality of life in the
domains of psychological and social health in comparison to the partner+ group.
Higher general quality of life was associated with higher social support, higher 
sense of coherence and fewer symptoms of depression. Predictors for a higher
quality of life were male gender, fewer symptoms of depression, a higher sense of
coherence, higher perceived social support and living together with the marital
partner.
CONCLUSION: Family separation of Syrian refugees with a residence permit in
Germany can have an impact on their quality of life. Longitudinal studies are
needed to confirm our results and determine the long-term effects of family
separation.

Controlled aliasing for improved parallel imaging with a 3D spiral staircase
trajectory.

Anderson AG 3rd(1), Wang D(2), Pipe JG(2).

Author information: 
(1)Philips Healthcare, Gainesville, Florida.
(2)Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.

PURPOSE: To introduce a modified 3D stack-of-spirals trajectory and efficient
SENSE reconstruction for improved through-plane undersampling, while maintaining 
SNR efficiency and other benefits of spiral acquisitions.
METHODS: A novel spiral staircase trajectory is introduced. This trajectory is a 
modified stack of spirals, in which spiral arms are distributed between
partitions along kz . The trajectory maintains the efficient separable
reconstruction with a Cartesian fast Fourier transform along the kz direction,
followed by a 2D slice-by-slice gridding reconstruction. An additional
intermediate step introduces a phase correction to collapse the spiral arms into 
the prescribed slice planes. For data undersampled through plane, this produces
aliasing with reduced coherence, controlled by the arm-ordering. Undersampled
data can then be reconstructed with reduced g-factor using a conjugate
gradient-based iterative SENSE algorithm.
RESULTS: The trajectory significantly improves g-factor for through-plane
accelerated acquisitions. Improvement manifests through both reduced overall
g-factor and reduced structure in the g-factor maps. In the presented
experiments, the mean g-factor decreased from 1.26 to 0.93 and the maximum
g-factor decreased from 3.89 to 1.15 for R = 2 spiral staircase when compared
with stack of spirals, and the mean g-factor decreased from 2.51 to 0.94 and the 
maximum g-factor decreased from 8.26 to 1.35 for R = 3 spiral staircase when
compared with stack of spirals.
CONCLUSION: The novel spiral staircase trajectory offers improved aliasing
characteristics for through-plane parallel imaging acceleration in 3D spiral
acquisitions.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) 
of older adults participating or not in Seniors Centers (SC).
METHODS: Two independent samples were compared: older adults who participate in
SC (n = 124) and older adults who visited Primary Healthcare Centers (PHC) and do
not participate in SC (n = 164). The data collected consisted of sociodemographic
(sex, age, educational level, marital status, family income) and psychosocial
characteristics-Sense of Coherence (SOC), anxiety and depression using HADS,
happiness-, and oral clinical evaluation-use and need of dental prosthesis and
decayed (D), missing (M), or filled (F) teeth. The resulting OHRQoL was evaluated
using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). The Mann-Whitney test was used to
assess the associations between the independent variables and the OHIP-14.
Poisson regression models were also used in the analyses (α=0.05).
RESULTS: In the PHC, of the 270 individuals invited to participate in the study, 
164 (60.7%) were interviewed and clinically examined; while in the SC, of the 166
individuals invited to participate in the study, 124 (74.7%) were interviewed and
clinically examined. After adjustments for sociodemographic, psychosocial and
clinical factors, we found that the impact on OHRQoL was 2.8 times higher (95%CI 
2.0-4.2) for older adults who did not participate in SC.
CONCLUSION: Older adults who participated in SC showed better perception on
OHRQoL, independently of sociodemographic, psychosocial and clinical factors.

OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of long-term pain and disability in knee
osteoarthritis.
DESIGN: A longitudinal cohort study of five years.
SETTING: Primary care providers.
SUBJECTS: In all, 108 patients (mean age = 63.6 years, standard deviation (SD) = 
7.2 years) with knee pain (⩾40 mm on a 100 mm visual analogue scale in the
Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index pain
scale) and radiographic grading (Kellgren-Lawrence: 2-4) of knee osteoarthritis
who participated in a randomized controlled trial.
MAIN MEASURES: Disease-specific pain and functioning were assessed using the
corresponding WOMAC subscales. Generic functioning was assessed by the RAND-36
subscales for function and physical and mental component summary scores. Possible
baseline predictors for these outcomes were (1) demographic and disease-related
variables and (2) psychological variables of mood (anxiety, depression),
pain-related cognitions (pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing,
kinesiophobia), and positive resource factors (life satisfaction, sense of
coherence).
RESULTS: Multivariate linear mixed model analyses revealed that minimal anxiety
at baseline predicted significantly better results for pain (WOMAC, P = 0.019)
and function (WOMAC, P = 0.001, RAND-36 function P = 0.001). High pain
self-efficacy predicted significantly better scores in RAND-36 function (P =
0.006), physical (P = 0.004) and mental (P = 0.001) component summaries. Pain
catastrophizing predicted higher pain (P = 0.015), whereas fear of movement
predicted poorer functioning in RAND-36 physical (P = 0.016) and mental (P =
0.009) component summaries. Those satisfied with life reported higher scores in
RAND-36 function (P = 0.002) and mental component summary (P = 0.041). A low
number of comorbidities predicted significantly better results in pain (WOMAC P =
0.019) and function (WOMAC P = 0.033, RAND-36 P = 0.009).
CONCLUSION: Anxiety, pain-related cognitions, and psychological resources predict
symptoms in knee osteoarthritis in the long term.

Background: There is a paucity of research on the long-term impact of
stress-reduction in Hispanic/Latina breast cancer (BC) survivors, a growing
minority. In this article, we assess the long-term efficacy of an 8-week training
program in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on quality of life (QoL) in 
Hispanic BC survivors. Methods: Hispanic BC survivors, within the first 5 years
of diagnosis, stages I to III BC, were recruited. Participants were enrolled in
bilingual, 8-week intensive group training in MBSR and were asked to practice a- 
home, daily. They were also provided with audio recordings and a book on
mindfulness practices. Patient-reported outcomes for QoL and distress were
evaluated at baseline, and every 3 months, for 24 months. Results: Thirty-three
self-identified Hispanic women with BC completed the MBSR program and were
followed at 24 months. Statistically significant reduction was noted for the
Generalized Anxiety Disorder measure (mean change -2.39, P=0.04); and Patient
Health Questionnaire (mean change -2.27, P=0.04), at 24 months, compared with
baseline. Improvement was noted in the Short-Form 36 Health-related QoL Mental
Component Summary with an increase of 4.07 (95% confidence interval = 0.48-7.66, 
P=0.03). However, there was no significant change in the Physical Component
Summary. Conclusions: Hispanic BC survivors who participated in an 8-week
MBSR-based survivorship program reported persistent benefits with reduced
anxiety, depression, and improved mental health QoL over 24 months of follow-up. 
Stress reduction programs are beneficial and can be implemented as part of a
comprehensive survivorship care in BC patients.

OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to compare the level of sense of coherence in
hypertensive patients with arterial stiffness or leftventricular hypertrophy and 
in hypertensive individuals without such health complications.
METHODS: The study group consisted of 93 participants. All of them were asked to 
undergo the following procedures: clinical assessment, echocardiography (to
diagnose hypertensive cardiac damage), pulse wave velocity measurement (to assess
vascular damage) and psychological testing (to measure their level of
comprehensibility, manageability, meaningfulness, and sense of coherence).
RESULTS: Patients with hypertensive vascular damage (high pulse wave velocity)
had higher levels of comprehensibility and sense of coherence than other
hypertensive subjects. At the same time, there were no significant differences in
the level of sense of coherence (and all of its dimensions) between individuals
with and people without hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest, that the sense of coherence may 
not be strongly associated with good somatic health. They may also contribute to 
the discussion about diagnostic usefulness of the SOC-29 method as a single tool.
We believe that the level of sense of coherence should be taken into
consideration in further studies on the development of hypertensive TOD.

PURPOSE: The Symptom Navi© Programme (SN©P) is a structured nurse-led
intervention supporting symptom self-management in cancer patients. We describe
the development and evaluation of the intervention, implementation strategy, and 
the evaluation of nurse training for the Symptom Navi© Pilot Study.
METHODS: The intervention was developed using multiple methods (e.g. literature
synthesis, focus groups) to produce SN©P information leaflets (SN©Flyers in
French and German) and standardised training for nurses to deliver
semi-structured consultations. We evaluated the SN©P using online surveys, focus 
groups, interviews, and the Item-Content Validity Index (I-CVI). Nurse training
was evaluated in relation to content, acceptability, and confidence in
implementing the SN©P. We examined the association between scored on the
Work-related Sense of Coherence (Work-SoC) scale and nurses' confidence in
implementing the SN©P. Thematic analysis was used to analyse qualitative data.
Quantitative data was descriptively analysed and the Kendall Tau test was
employed for correlations.
RESULTS: Patients and health care professionals confirmed that SN©Flyers and
semi-structured consultations facilitated symptom self-management. Nurses
considered training content/format acceptable and appropriate and felt confident 
in implementing the SN©P. Overall Work-SoC scores were correlated with nurses'
confidence in implementing the SN©P (rπ = .47, p = .04).
CONCLUSIONS: Health care professionals and cancer patients perceived the SN©P as 
a useful support. Successful implementation of the SN©P depends on
centre-specific factors including time, resources and workflow.

OBJECTIVES: People with life-limiting diseases such as dementia are living
longer. How to improve the quality of life of those living with dementia is an
important challenge for society. Continuity maintenance in older adulthood is a
psychosocial adaptation strategy by searching for preference and familiarity,
making a sense of connection, and creating coherence. Continuity maintenance is a
useful concept for effective dementia care, which could bring psychosocial
benefits. This review investigates effective ways of continuity maintenance for
people with dementia (PWD).
STUDY DESIGN: A rapid realist review (RRR) of a comprehensive range of databases 
was conducted.
METHODS: Realist review methodology provides an explanatory analysis of what
works for whom, in what circumstances, and is characterized by its focus on
strategies/interventions, contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes. A literature search
was conducted using four databases, and articles discussing potential
interventions to maintain continuity in PWD were included. Data were extracted on
key variables related to contextual factors, mechanisms, and outcomes.
RESULTS: Four key themes emerged: (1) maintaining personal identity, (2)
maintaining social identity, (3) keeping a familiar environment, and (4)
sustaining daily activities. It is hypothesized that these four factors combine
and interact to maintain continuity and ultimately lead to psychosocial benefits.
CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance of identity, environment, and activities is central to
continuity for PWD. The resulting model and program theories respond to the need 
for a coherent approach to continuity maintenance. Using the foundations created 
by this RRR, nursing homes may psychosocially improve PWD through maintaining
continuity.

OBJECTIVES: Dental caries is the most common chronic childhood disease that
occurs in a continuum and can be prevented by children and their parents'
adherence to recommended oral health behaviors. Theory-driven tools help
practitioners to identify the causes for poor adherence and develop effective
interventions. This study examined the Expanded Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB)
Model by adding the concept of Sense of Coherence (SOC) to predict parental
adherence to preschooler's preventive dental visits.
METHODS: Data regarding socio-economic demographics were collected from parents
of children aged 2-6 years. Constructs of TPB including parental attitudes,
subjective norms (SN), Perceived Behavioural Control (PBC), and intention to
attend preventive dental visits for their preschoolers were collected by
questionnaire, alongside parents' sense of coherence (SOC). Dental attendance was
measured by asking if the child had a regular dental visit during the last year. 
Structural Equation Modeling Analysis (SEMA) was carried out to identify
significant direct and indirect (mediated) pathways in the extended TPB model.
RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy-eight mothers (mean age = 34.41 years, range
22-48) participated in the study. The mean age of children was 3.92 years, range:
2-6), and 75.9% had dental insurance. Results of the final model showed that
predisposing factors (child's birthplace and mother's birthplace) significantly
predicted enabling resources (family monthly income and child's dental insurance 
status); both predicted the TPB components (PBC, SN, and attitude). TPB
components, in turn, predicted behavioural intention. However, contrary to
expectation, intention did not significantly predict dental attendance in the
past 12 months. Parent's SOC significantly predicted TPB components and dental
attendance. Overall, 56% of the variance in dental attendance was explained by
the expanded TPB model.
CONCLUSIONS: The expanded TPB model explained a great deal of variance in
preschooler's dental attendance. These findings suggest that the expanded model
could be used as the framework for designing interventions or strategies to
enhance dental attendance among preschoolers; in particular, such strategies
should focus specifically on enhancing parental SOC including empowerment.

INTRODUCTION: Research on stroke rehabilitation mainly concerns the first year of
recovery, and there is a lack of knowledge regarding long-term rehabilitation
needs and associated factors.
AIM: The aim was to explore the perceived needs for rehabilitation services of
people six years after stroke and factors associated with having rehabilitation
services needs met.
METHODS: The study was a 6-year follow up of a prospective study on the
rehabilitation process after stroke. Data on perceived needs for rehabilitation, 
personal factors, disease specific factors, and patient-reported disability were 
collected through face-to-face interviews in the participants' homes. Logistic
regression models were created to explore associations between having
rehabilitation services needs met in 11 problem areas (dependent variable) and
the independent variables: involvement in decisions regarding care and treatment,
sex, age, sense of coherence, self-defined level of private financing, stroke
severity, frequency of social everyday activities, perceived impact of stroke,
and life satisfaction.
RESULTS: The 121 participants had a mean age of 63 years at stroke onset and 58% 
were men. In all problem areas the majority (53-88%) reported having needs met at
six years after stroke, however 47% reported unmet needs regarding fatigue and
45% regarding mobility. A lower perceived impact on participation was found to be
associated with having rehabilitation services needs met in seven problem areas: 
mobility, falls, pain, fatigue, concentration, memory, and sight. The strongest
association for having needs met was found for the independent variable,
involvement in care and treatment, within the three problem areas mobility,
falls, and speaking.
CONCLUSION: In a long-term perspective, there were several modifiable factors
associated with having rehabilitation services needs met. The most prominent were
perceived involvement in care and treatment, and perceived participation. These
factors had a stronger association with having rehabilitation services needs met 
than disease specific factors six years after stroke.

OBJECTIVES: To validate questionnaire items assessing American Indian (AI)
parental beliefs regarding control over their children's oral health within the
context of psychosocial measures and children's oral health status.
METHODS: Baseline questionnaire data were collected as part of a randomized
controlled trial (n = 1016) addressing early childhood caries. Participants were 
AI parents with preschool-age children in the Navajo Nation Head Start program.
Questionnaire items assessed parental oral health locus of control (OHLOC) and
agreement with beliefs indicating that they were in control of their children's
oral health (internal), the dentist was in control (external powerful others), or
children's oral health was a matter of chance (external chance). Exploratory
factor analysis was conducted, and convergent validity was assessed using linear 
regression.
RESULTS: Parents with more education (p < 0.0001) and income (p = 0.001) had
higher scores for internal OHLOC. Higher internal OHLOC scores were associated
with higher scores on knowledge (p < 0.0001), perceived seriousness and benefits 
(p < 0.0001), higher self-efficacy, importance, sense of coherence (p < 0.0001
for all), and lower scores for perceived barriers (p < 0.0001) and distress (p = 
0.01). Higher scores for both types of external OHLOC were associated with lower 
scores on knowledge (p < 0.0001), perceived seriousness (p < 0.0001), and higher 
scores on perceived susceptibility (p = 0.01 external chance; <0.0001 powerful
others) and barriers (<0.0001). Higher scores for external powerful others were
associated with lower scores for importance (p = 0.04) and sense of coherence (p 
= 0.03). Significant associations were not found for OHLOC beliefs and children's
oral health status.
CONCLUSIONS: Questionnaire items addressing OHLOC functioned in accordance with
the theoretical framework in AI participants.

Africa, Pretoria, South Africa.

Background: Mental health and salutogenesis are important topics at universities 
in China and Germany where heightening stress levels in students can be observed.
Aim: The aim of this article is to determine the profile of the salutogenic
concept, sense of coherence (SOC), in Chinese and German students to provide new 
insights into SOC and mental health in Chinese and German students in higher
education institutions (HEIs).
Setting: The study was carried out at universities in China and Germany.
Method: A non-experimental, cross-sectional, survey-based research design and
convenience sampling was utilised to obtain the sample (n = 356). The sample was 
derived at a selected Chinese (n = 255) and a selected German university (n =
101). Data were gathered using the 7-point Likert SOC dimension scales based on
the Life-Orientation Questionnaire (LOQ) research instrument. The internal
consistency levels of the SOC sub-scales were of acceptable levels. Descriptive
and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. Cronbach's alpha
coefficients were calculated to determine the reliability of the LOQ research
instrument. General linear modelling techniques.
Results: The results showed the Chinese students scored significantly lower in
all three SOC scales than the German students, with the largest practical
significant difference in the sub-score of meaningfulness. In general, female
Chinese and German students scored higher than their male counterparts. No
significant differences could be found between German female and male, and
Chinese female and male students.
Conclusion: Conclusions and recommendations for future research and HEI practice 
are provided.

Background: Generating, reading, or interpreting data is a component of
Telemedicine-Intensive Care Unit (Tele-ICU) utilization that has not been
explored in the literature. Introduction: Using the idea of "coherence," a
construct of Normalization Process Theory, we describe how intensive care unit
(ICU) and Tele-ICU staff made sense of their shared work and how they made use of
Tele-ICU together. Materials and Methods: We interviewed ICU and Tele-ICU staff
involved in the implementation of Tele-ICU during site visits to a Tele-ICU hub
and 3 ICUs, at preimplementation (43 interviews with 65 participants) and 6
months postimplementation (44 interviews with 67 participants). Data were
analyzed using deductive coding techniques and lexical searches. Results: In the 
early implementation of Tele-ICU, ICU and Tele-ICU staff lacked consensus about
how to share information and consequently how to make use of innovations in data 
tracking and interpretation offered by the Tele-ICU (e.g., acuity systems).
Attempts to collaborate and create opportunities for utilization were supported
by quality improvement (QI) initiatives. Discussion: Characterizing Tele-ICU
utilization as an element of a QI process limited how ICU staff understood
Tele-ICU as an innovation. It also did not promote an understanding of how the
Tele-ICU used data and may therefore attenuate the larger promise of Tele-ICU as 
a potential tool for leveraging big data in critical care. Conclusions: Shared
data practices lay the foundation for Tele-ICU program utilization but raise new 
questions about how the promise of big data can be operationalized for bedside
ICU staff.

Life Crafting as a Way to Find Purpose and Meaning in Life.

Schippers MC(1), Ziegler N(1).

Author information:

Management, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands.

Having a purpose in life is one of the most fundamental human needs. However, for
most people, finding their purpose in life is not obvious. Modern life has a way 
of distracting people from their true goals and many people find it hard to
define their purpose in life. Especially at younger ages, people are searching
for meaning in life, but this has been found to be unrelated to actually finding 
meaning. Oftentimes, people experience pressure to have a "perfect" life and show
the world how well they are doing, instead of following up on their deep-felt
values and passions. Consequently, people may need a more structured way of
finding meaning, e.g., via an intervention. In this paper, we discuss
evidence-based ways of finding purpose, via a process that we call "life
crafting." This process fits within positive psychology and the salutogenesis
framework - an approach focusing on factors that support human health and
well-being, instead of factors that cause disease. This process ideally starts
with an intervention that entails a combination of reflecting on one's values,
passions and goals, best possible self, goal attainment plans, and other positive
psychology intervention techniques. Important elements of such an intervention
are: (1) discovering values and passion, (2) reflecting on current and desired
competencies and habits, (3) reflecting on present and future social life, (4)
reflecting on a possible future career, (5) writing about the ideal future, (6)
writing down specific goal attainment and "if-then" plans, and (7) making public 
commitments to the goals set. Prior research has shown that personal goal setting
and goal attainment plans help people gain a direction or a sense of purpose in
life. Research findings from the field of positive psychology, such as
salutogenesis, implementation intentions, value congruence, broaden-and-build,
and goal-setting literature, can help in building a comprehensive evidence-based 
life-crafting intervention. This intervention can aid individuals to find a
purpose in life, while at the same time ensuring that they make concrete plans to
work toward this purpose. The idea is that life crafting enables individuals to
take control of their life in order to optimize performance and happiness.

Purpose: This study aims to explore the mediating role of sense of coherence in
the relationship of type C personality and depression among newly diagnosed
breast cancer patients.
Methods: A descriptive and correlational survey was conducted in 600 breast
cancer patients aged ≥18 years from September 2018 to March 2019 in Zhengzhou,
China. The demographic questionnaire, Cancer Behavior Scale, Sense of Coherence
Scale and Hamilton Depression Scale were included in this study. Data analysis
was performed by correlation analysis, multiple linear regression analysis, and
structural equation modeling.
Results: The valid questionnaires were 575 (effective response rate: 95.8%). The 
score of sense of coherence was negatively correlated with type C personality and
depression (r = -0.41, P < 0.01; r = -0.58, P < 0.01); the score of type C
personality and depression were positively correlated (r = 0.51, P < 0.01). The
results of multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the effect of type C
personality on depression was partly mediated by sense of coherence, which was
confirmed by structural equation modeling. The mediation effect accounts for
45.2% (0.269/0.594) of the total effect.
Conclusion: The results of this study revealed that sense of coherence as a
partial mediating role is essential for reducing the influence of type C
personality on depression. Early and targeted psychological interventions on
sense of coherence are needed to alleviate the symptom of depression in newly
diagnosed breast cancer patients.

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of curcumin
formulation with a polyvinylpyrrolidone-hydrophilic carrier (CHC*;
Diabec®-AlfaIntes, Italy) for the treatment of macular edema (ME) from uncommon
etiologies. We conducted retrospective interventional case series, reviewing the 
medical records of patients referred to the Eye Center, Humanitas Hospital,
Bergamo due to persistent ME related to uncommon causes and treated by oral
administration of CHC. The main outcomes assessed were best-corrected visual
acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), and the presence of intraretinal 
and/or subretinal fluid (SRF). Only patients with a minimum follow-up (f/u) of 6 
months were included. The occurrence of any adverse effect was registered.
Thirty-one eyes of 30 patients were included, with a mean f/u of 8.32 ± 1.77
months. Of them, 9 patients (10 eyes) were affected by postoperative ME and 21 by
chronic central serous chorioretinopathy. Median BCVA significantly improved
after treatment, changing from 0.3 [0.16-0.5] to 0.1 [0-0.3] logarithm of the
minimum angle of resolution (P < .001). Also CMT was significantly improved, as
it decreased from 400 [364-438] μm before treatment to 280 [242-307] μm at the
last f/u visit (P < .001). The complete absorption of intraretinal/SRF was
detected in 23 of 31 eyes (74%) at the final f/u. No adverse effects were
registered. In conclusion, treatment with CHC was effective and safe for eyes
affected by ME of various uncommon etiologies, resulting in significant
improvement of both functional and anatomical outcomes, with the complete
resolution of the edema in the majority of cases (74%).

PURPOSE: To explore the experiences of haematopoietic stem cell transplant
survivors attending the long-term follow-up unit.
METHODS: A descriptive qualitative study of eight post-haematopoietic stem cell
transplant survivors which were interviewed guided by the sense of coherence
framework. Thematic analysis was used to extract meaningful explication of the
survivors' experiences.
RESULTS: The post-haematopoietic stem cell transplant survivors interviewed were 
five females and three males with age ranging from 27 to 67 years and had the
stem cell transplant between 4 and 20 years. Three main themes emerged from the
data including (1) comprehending the experience, (2) acknowledging the
meaningfulness of the experience and (3) managing threats to a new life after the
transplant. The experiences of post-haematopoietic stem cell transplant survivors
were initially difficult but they were able to make re-adjustments to their new
life by reconciling with their new identity, refocusing on meaningful activities,
strengthening their resilience and navigating the healthcare system.
CONCLUSION: In spite of the difficulties faced by the survivors, they were able
to face the challenges and made adjustment in a positive light by focusing on the
valuable aspects of their experiences. Health care practitioners need to
continually support them throughout their survivorship journey no matter how long
it takes. Any long-term follow-up unit is a step in the right direction to meet
the complex needs of the survivors by integrating and adapting clinical
guidelines into routine oncologic and transplant care so that survivors are not
lost in transition following treatment.

PURPOSE: Kidney transplant recipients suffer from a variety of symptoms, and
symptom management is crucial in improving their quality of life (QOL).
Accordingly, this study aims to identify the symptoms experienced by kidney
transplant recipients and examine the relationship amongst antecedents, symptom
experience and QOL of recipients in China.
METHODS: A total of 300 kidney transplant recipients were investigated in one of 
the most first-rate hospitals in China by asking them to fill out a self-designed
general questionnaire, the Symptom Experience Scale, the Sense of Coherence Scale
(Chinese version), the Revised Life Orientation Test (Chinese version) and the
36-item Short Form Health Survey (Chinese version).
RESULTS: Kidney transplant recipients experienced multiple symptoms that were
frequent, severe and bothersome. The final model showed significant consistency
with the data. In the QOL model, post-transplant time, complications,
immunosuppressive agents and sense of coherence explained 30.7% of the variance
of symptom experience. Moreover, habitual residence, economic burden,
post-transplant time, kidney function, optimism and symptom experience accounted 
for 70.6% of the variance on QOL.
CONCLUSIONS: We can explain the relationship between antecedents, symptom
experience and QOL amongst Chinese kidney transplant recipients by using Symptoms
Experience Model. Clinicians and caregivers can manage the recipient's symptoms
during follow-up from psychological, physical and medication management
perspectives. Improving sense of coherence, maintaining optimism and managing
symptoms are essential for enhancing QOL.

An investigation of a wavepacket model for free-jet and jet-surface interaction
noise was conducted. The source term for the axisymmetric mode was extracted from
a Mach 0.9 jet large eddy simulation and employed to adjust the parameters of a
simple source model. Streamwise coherence decay, in particular, was considered.
The source model was propagated with both the free-field and tailored Green's
function for a semi-infinite flat plate positioned at a distance of r/D = 1 from 
the jet axis. Significant deviations were observed in the prediction of the
low-angle directivity of the isolated jet as well as in the reproduction of the
characteristics of the source field. However, the effects of trailing edge noise 
were well reproduced. The installed jet case, at the region dominated by
trailing-edge scattering, showed very little sensitivity to the coherence decay, 
a crucial feature in the isolated jet case. In this sense, the modelling of the
installed-jet case proved to be much simpler.

Temperament and Sense of Coherence: Emotional Intelligence as a Mediator.

Szcześniak M(1), Strochalska K(1).

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Psychology, University of Szczecin, 71-017 Szczecin, Poland.

Sense of coherence (SOC) reflects an individual's capacity and available
resources to deal with stressful situations. For some time now studies have
revealed that people differ in their experience of SOC; yet, very little is known
about how and through which mechanisms a high level of SOC is formed. In order to
increase our understanding about the paths to a high SOC in the stage of
adulthood, we focused on exploring the role both of temperament, as it has been
confirmed as a potential component in the development of more complex traits that
emerge later in life, and of emotional intelligence (EI) as it has been found to 
increase SOC. The sample consisted of 173 participants between 18 and 49. We used
the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa and San Diego Autoquestionnaire
(TEMPS-A), Orientation to Life Questionnaire (OLQ), and Emotional Intelligence
Questionnaire (INTE). Results showed a negative correlation between the
depressive, cyclothymic, irritable, and anxious dimensions of temperament and
SOC, and EI. There was also a positive correlation between hyperthymic
temperament and SOC, and EI. EI correlated positively with a general sense of
coherence and its three dimensions. The PROCESS macro for SPSS showed that
emotional intelligence mediates the relationship between depressive, cyclothymic,
hyperthymic, irritable and anxious temperament, comprehensibility, manageability,
meaningfulness, and global orientation to life. On the basis of the obtained
outcomes, it can be stated that emotional intelligence mediates the relationship 
between dimensions of temperament and dimensions of SOC.

Over a period of 15 years several attempts to conceptualize mindfulness have been
presented and revised, but there is still no clear or agreed-upon definition. The
use of mindfulness-based interventions has increased in clinical and research
settings the last couple of years, including in Sweden. As a clinician it is
crucial to know if a treatment works through the theoretically postulated
mechanisms of change. Mindfulness is a concept that is difficult to measure. The 
overall aim of the current project was to examine the psychometric properties of 
the Swedish version of the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ_SWE) using 
three different studies. To test the construct validity of the FFMQ_SWE a
hierarchal confirmatory factor analysis was performed in a meditating
non-clinical sample, to examine if all the five facets would load on an overall
mindfulness construct. Psychometric properties of the instrument were examined in
a non-clinical and a clinical sample, and discriminative relationships with other
variables were analysed. The convergent validity was examined by analysing the
correlations between FFMQ_SWE and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Sense of
Coherence and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. Test-retest reliability
was tested by distributing FFMQ_SWE at two occasions. The hierarchal confirmatory
factor analysis showed good fit in a population of meditators. The FFMQ_SWE
showed good convergent validity and test-retest reliability in both clinical and 
non-clinical populations. In sum, the Swedish version of the FFMQ showed good
psychometric properties and can be a useful instrument as an evaluation of
treatment effects in both health care settings and research settings.

Purpose: The number of psychosocial Clubhouses is growing rapidly in Norway.
However, more knowledge is needed about the subjective experience of Clubhouse
members in terms of their recuperation processes and experiences in the Clubhouse
context. Therefore, this qualitative study explored what it is like to be a
Clubhouse member in Norway, and further discuss it in light of the theory of
Salutogenesis on successful pathways to coping and well-being.Methods: Using a
hermeneutic-phenomenological approach, the present study included in-depth,
semi-structured individual interviews with 18 Clubhouse members from three
accredited Norwegian Clubhouses. Analysis was conducted using systematic text
condensation.Results: Three main themes emerged from the analysis: "Finally, I
belong somewhere I can be proud of," "I feel more like an ordinary citizen, just 
different," and "I feel somewhat equal to others." Overall, the participants
experienced improved mental and social well-being owing to their membership of a 
Clubhouse.Conclusions: Our findings correspond with previous international
research. Owing to the positive effect participation in the Clubhouse seem to
have on members' motivation, Salutogenesis might help explain helpful processes
within the model. Moreover, the model might be a relevant example for policy and 
service development in mental health care and the labour market.

Globally, gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) experience an
increased burden of poor sexual, mental and physical health. Syndemics theory
provides a framework to understand comorbidities and health among marginalised
populations. Syndemics theory attempts to account for the social, environmental, 
and other structural contexts that are driving and/or sustaining simultaneous
multiple negative health outcomes, but has been widely critiqued. In this paper, 
we conceptualise a new framework to counter syndemics by assessing the key
theoretical mechanisms by which pathogenic social context variables relate to
ill-health. Subsequently, we examine how salutogenic, assets-based approaches to 
health improvement could function among GBMSM across diverse national contexts.
Comparative quantitative secondary analysis of data on syndemics and community
assets are presented from two international, online, cross-sectional surveys of
GBMSM (SMMASH2 in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland
and Sex Now in Canada). Negative sexual, mental and physical health outcomes were
clustered as hypothesised, providing evidence of the syndemic. We found that
syndemic ill-health was associated with social isolation and the experience of
stigma and discrimination, but this varied across national contexts. Moreover,
while some of our measures of community assets appeared to have a protective
effect on syndemic ill-health, others did not. These results present an important
step forward in our understanding of syndemic ill-health and provide new insights
into how to intervene to reduce it. They point to a theoretical mechanism through
which salutogenic approaches to health improvement could function and provide new
strategies for working with communities to understand the proposed processes of
change that are required. To move forward, we suggest conceptualising syndemics
within a complex adaptive systems model, which enables consideration of the
development, sustainment and resilience to syndemics both within individuals and 
at the population-level.

According to the currently prevailing theory, the magnetic compass sense in
night-migrating birds relies on a light-dependent radical-pair-based mechanism.
It has been shown that radio waves at megahertz frequencies disrupt magnetic
orientation in migratory birds, providing evidence for a quantum-mechanical
origin of the magnetic compass. Still, many crucial properties, e.g. the lifetime
of the proposed magnetically sensitive radical pair, remain unknown. The current 
study aims to estimate the spin coherence time of the radical pair, based on the 
behavioural responses of migratory birds to broadband electromagnetic fields
covering the frequency band 0.1-100 kHz. A finding that the birds were unable to 
use their magnetic compass under these conditions would imply surprisingly
long-lived (greater than 10 µs) spin coherence. However, we observed no effect of
0.1-100 kHz radiofrequency (RF) fields on the orientation of night-migratory
Eurasian blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla). This suggests that the lifetime of the
spin coherence involved in magnetoreception is shorter than the period of the
highest frequency RF fields used in this experiment (i.e. approx. 10 µs). This
result, in combination with an earlier study showing that 20-450 kHz
electromagnetic fields disrupt magnetic compass orientation, suggests that the
spin coherence lifetime of the magnetically sensitive radical pair is in the
range 2-10 µs.

AIM: To investigate the mediation role of social support in the relationship
between a sense of coherence and the perception of professional interests among
Chinese registered nurses.
BACKGROUND: Job burnout is become exceedingly common among registered nurses.
Perceived professional benefits and a sense of coherence can help regulate
nurses' negative emotions, reduce job burnout and turnover intention and increase
nurses' subjective well-being. However, little is known about the mediating
effect of social support on sense of coherence and perceived professional
benefits.
METHODS: From May to August 2017, data from 765 Chinese registered nurses were
collected from a 4-part questionnaire: general information, the sense of
coherence scale, social support rating scale and perceived professional benefits 
questionnaire. The independent factors of perceived professional benefits were
tested by multiple regression analysis. Structural equation model was used to
study the moderating effect of social support.
RESULTS: The mean perceived professional benefits score differed across
professional title (p < .001). Social support mediated 58% of the relationships
between a sense of coherence and perceived professional benefits.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study revealed that social support partially
mediates the relationship between a sense of coherence and perceived professional
benefits among Chinese registered nurses. Therefore, interventions based on
social support to enhance the sense of coherence and to strengthen nurses'
perceived professional benefits should be developed.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nursing managers should create more learning
opportunities to improve nurses' abilities in clinical nursing and the social
support of nurses through many ways, so as to enhance nurses' sense of coherence 
and nurses' perceived professional benefits.

PURPOSE: Detect and quantify morpho-functional alterations of the retina and
choroid in patients affected by familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) treated with
lipoprotein apheresis (LA) using optic coherence tomography (OCT) and optic
coherence tomography-angriography (OCTA).
DESIGN: Observational study.
SUBJECTS: To be diagnosed: A group of 20 patients (40 eyes) being clinically and 
genetically diagnosed as FH and under treatment (FH-Group)", for at least 2
years, was compared to a control group of 20 healthy subjects (40 eyes), with a
normal lipid profile and no ocular disease (CT-Group).
METHODS: Participants were studied with the slit lamp, binocular indirect
fundoscopy, OCT and OCTA.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Best corrected visual acuity (BVCA), spherical equivalent 
(SE), intraocular pressure (IOP), central macular thickness (CMT), choroidal
thickness (CHT), retinal nerve fiber layer in four quadrants (RNFL
(Superior = Sup; Inferior = Inf; Nasal = Nas Temporal = Temp), and the mean value
across the four quadrants (RNFL G), foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and vascular
density (VD).
RESULTS: FH subjects had smaller RNFL superiorly (108 ± 19,38 μm
OD/111 ± 16,56 μm OS FH-Group vs 127 ± 7,42 μm OD/129 ± 14,64 μm OS CT-Group;
P < 0,001 for both OD and OS) and inferiorly (108 ± 23,58 μm OD/115 ± 17,33 μm OS
FH-Group vs 128 ± 18,15 μm OD/133 ± 17,38 μm OS CT-Group; P = 0,002 OD; P = 0,001
OS). G RNFL was consequently smaller (93 ± 12,94 μm OD/94 ± 10,49 μm OS FH-Group 
vs 101 ± 9,01 μm OD/101 ± 10,20 μm OS CT-Group; P = 0,03 OD; P = 0,02 OS). FH
subjects had a larger FAZ (0,31 ± 0,08 mm2 OD/0,33 ± 0,10 mm2 in OS FH-Group vs
0,21 ± 0,05 mm2 OD/0,21 ± 0,07 mm2 OS CT-Group; P < 0,001 OD; P = 0,002 OS).
CONCLUSIONS: Early signs of retinal vessel damage in FH patients can be detected 
and quantified with OCT and OCTA.

Purpose: Palliative care services are multidisciplinary, and the quality needs to
be evaluated from the patients' perspectives. The aim was to explore the patient 
profiles in palliative care with respect to patients' perception of the quality
of palliative care received and patient satisfaction, and to describe and compare
person-related and organization-related conditions that characterize the patient 
profiles.
Patients and methods: A cross-sectional study, including 140 patients from four
different multidisciplinary palliative care contexts in Norway, was conducted in 
2014. The Quality from the Patient's Perspective questionnaire for Palliative
Care, which is based upon a person-centered theoretical model, was used.
Satisfaction was measured by the Emotional Stress Reaction questionnaire. Person-
and organization-related conditions were measured. Hierarchical cluster analysis,
ANOVA, Pearson Chi-Square Test and ANCOVA were used.
Results: Three unique patient clusters with different patterns of perceptions of 
quality of care and satisfaction were identified; Cluster 1 (41%) had the best
perception of care quality and were more satisfied, Cluster 2 (34%) had better
perceptions of care quality and were most satisfied and Cluster 3 (25%) had worst
perceptions of care quality and were less satisfied. The clusters were
characterized by person-related conditions (eg, patients' sense of coherence and 
perceptions of subjective importance of the quality) as well as
organization-related conditions (eg, physicians' competence and type of care
services).
Conclusion: The results can be used by multidisciplinary healthcare personnel to 
tailor quality work and improve person-centered care in palliative care contexts.
Improvement initiatives should focus on implementing a person-centered approach, 
increasing the palliative care competence of the personnel and facilitate
specialized palliative care services in the homecare context.

To evaluate whether grafting of autologous mesenchymal cells, adipose-derived
stem cells, and platelet-rich plasma into the supracoroideal space by surgical
treatment with the Limoli retinal restoration technique (LRRT) can exert a
beneficial effect in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients. Twenty-one eyes
underwent surgery and were divided based on retinal foveal thickness (FT) ≤ 190
or > 190 µm into group A-FT and group B-FT, respectively. The specific LRRT triad
was grafted in a deep scleral pocket above the choroid of each eye. At 6-month
follow-up, group B showed a non-significant improvement in residual close-up
visus and sensitivity at microperimetry compared to group A. After an in-depth
review of molecular biology studies concerning degenerative phenomena underlying 
the etiopathogenesis of retinitis pigmentosa (RP), it was concluded that further 
research is needed on tapeto-retinal degenerations, both from a clinical and
molecular point of view, to obtain better functional results. In particular, it
is necessary to increase the number of patients, extend observation timeframes,
and treat subjects in the presence of still trophic retinal tissue to allow
adequate biochemical and functional catering.

Polyclinic in Bydgoszcz, Poland.

Introduction: An important part of the therapeutic process of patients with lung 
cancer undergoing palliative chemotherapy is to assess their mental well-being.
Evaluation of the sense of coherence and acceptance of the disease, which
reflects the degree of adaptation of the patient to live with the disease,
provides information on this topic.
Objective: The primary objective was to assess the level of sense of coherence
and acceptance of the disease in patients with lung cancer during palliative
chemotherapy as well as coherence and acceptance together with socio-demographic 
factors. The secondary objective was to assess the economic impact of lung cancer
on these patients.
Material and methods: The study involved 100 patients with lung cancer during
palliative chemotherapy. The study was conducted using the Sense of Coherence
Questionnaire (SOC-29), the Acceptance of Illness Scale, and a socio-demographic 
questionnaire.
Results: The study group consisted mainly of men (66%), people with
primary/vocational education (63%) and patients living in cities (59%). The
average age of respondents was 62.8 years. 45% of patients had a high level of
sense of coherence, and 44% had an average level. The average overall score of
SOC was 143.9 points inside the upper range of average results. Levels of a sense
of comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness remained in close
relation to the average level: 48.91, 51.33, and 43.66 points, respectively. The 
average acceptance of the disease was 45% with the average total of 27.21 points.
Conclusions: Most patients during palliative chemotherapy because of lung cancer 
had average or high level of coherence and acceptance of the disease. The level
of sense of coherence and acceptance of the disease was not affected by gender,
age, education, or place of residence. Almost all patients incur costs associated
with treatment, and in some of them the disease affected the source of income.

This article aims to build awareness of the growing global crisis in social,
economic and environmental terms from different disciplinary approaches. The
authors respond to the message of Pope Francis presented in his Encyclical Letter
published in 2015. The article provides a short current overview of the discourse
and presents three hypotheses anchored in the disciplines of Psychology, Health
and Theology for a deeper discussion of Pope Francis's viewpoints on the
challenges to humankind and how to address them. It thereby contributes to the
discourse on health and religion with regard to the Pope's message to the world
community. The article leads to an interdisciplinary conclusion and directions
for future research and practice.

The contribution of individual characteristics to predicting individual,
community and national resilience of Israeli Jews and Arabs was investigated.
Psychological resilience refers to people's assessment of their ability to
withstand negative psychological consequences of major afflictions, and to keep
functioning despite these adversities. The following hypotheses were examined: 1.
The Jewish sample would score higher than the Arab sample on indices of
individual, community and national resilience. 2. Men of both groups would score 
higher compared with women on these resilience indices. 3. Exposure to terror and
fear of upcoming war would negatively predict the resilience of both groups. 4.
Higher level of religiosity, right wing political attitudes, higher income,
higher education, older age and higher sense of coherence will positively predict
the investigated resiliencies. The random sample included 1100 Jews and 350 Arabs
who participated in an internet survey. Resilience was defined in this study as
the balance of individual, community and national strength (protective factors)
to vulnerability (risk factors). The results supported the first three hypotheses
whereas the fourth hypothesis was supported only for the Jewish sample. The
present study indicated that some predictors had universal effect on resilience, 
whereas others seemed to be culture specific predictors.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most frequent degenerative disease
affecting motor neurons (MN). ALS has been traditionally considered as a pure
motor system disease; however, there are currently sufficient evidences
supporting the involvement of other non-motor systems. Recently, the development 
and the implementation of the optical coherence tomography (OCT) have provided
new data regarding the ocular involvement in the disease. In this sense,
alterations in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL), other retinal layers
thicknesses such as outer nuclear layer (ONL) and inner nuclear layer (INL) and
changes in the retinal blood vessels have been described in ALS patients.
Interestingly, the study of ocular alterations in ALS appears not only as new
biomarker tool, but also as a new opportunity to deep into the pathogenesis of
the disease. In this article we will review and standardize published studies
regarding OCT and ALS, emphasizing both their strengths and weaknesses.

BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are increasingly being
used to prevent sudden death in the growing population of adults with congenital 
heart disease (CHD). However, little is known about their impact on
patient-reported outcomes (PROs).
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess and compare PROs in adults
with CHD with and without ICDs.
METHODS: A propensity-based matching weight analysis was conducted to evaluate
PROs in an international cross-sectional study of adults with CHD from 15
countries across 5 continents.
RESULTS: A total of 3188 patients were included: 107 with ICDs and 3081
weight-matched controls without ICDs. ICD recipients were an average age of 40.1 
± 12.4 years, and >95% had moderate or complex CHD. Defibrillators were implanted
for primary and secondary prevention in 38.3% and 61.7%, respectively. Perceived 
health status, psychological distress, sense of coherence, and health behaviors
did not differ significantly among patients with and without ICDs. However, ICD
recipients had a more threatening view of their illness (relative % difference
8.56; P = .011). Those with secondary compared to primary prevention indications 
had a significantly lower quality-of-life score (Linear Analogue Scale 72.0 ±
23.1 vs 79.2 ± 13.0; P = .047). Marked geographic variations were observed.
Overall sense of well-being, assessed by a summary score that combines various
PROs, was significantly lower in ICD recipients (vs controls) from Switzerland,
Argentina, Taiwan, and the United States.
CONCLUSION: In an international cohort of adults with CHD, ICDs were associated
with a more threatening illness perception, with a lower quality of life in those
with secondary compared to primary prevention indications. However, marked
geographic variability in PROs was observed.

OBJECTIVES: To test the relationship of predisposing, enabling and need
characteristics with dental services utilization and pattern of dental attendance
among 12-year-old schoolchildren living in a socially deprived urban area.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out involving 358 children enrolled 
in public schools located in a deprived area of the city of Manaus, Brazil.
Predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics were selected according to
Andersen's behavioral conceptual model. Self-completed questionnaires were used
to collect the predisposing characteristics (child's gender, sense of coherence, 
self-esteem, oral health beliefs). Parents or guardians provided data on enabling
characteristics, including dental health insurance and socioeconomic status.
Evaluated need characteristics included oral clinical status assessed through
dental examinations conducted by five calibrated examiners. Structural equation
modeling was used to test the predictors of dental services utilization and
pattern of dental attendance.
RESULTS: Predisposing characteristics, including male gender and low
parents/guardians sense of coherence predicted poor dental services utilization
and inadequate pattern of dental attendance, respectively. Low socioeconomic
status and poor oral clinical status were linked to poor dental services
utilization and worse children's pattern of dental attendance.
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that predisposing (child's gender and
parental sense of coherence), enabling (socioeconomic conditions) and evaluated
need characteristics (oral clinical status) are associated with dental services
utilization among children.

Living Conditions Influence Psychological Distress of Migrants in Long-Term
Imprisonment.

Lutz M(1), Streb J(1), Dudeck M(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Forensic Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Ulm University, Ulm,
Germany.

Background: Serving a long-term prison sentence places a heavy psychological
burden on inmates. The concept of salutogenesis and the psychological stress
model developed by Lazarus indicate that people can handle difficult situations
if they are able to use their resources in a way that makes them feel confident
that things will work out as well as can reasonably be expected. However, during 
long-term imprisonment inmates often have restricted access to potential coping
strategies, such as close and trusting relationships. Because of
migration-related difficulties, such as poor local language skills and
experiences of discrimination, migrants in long-term imprisonment probably
experience even more psychological distress than native citizens. Aims: The aim
of the study was to compare the amount of psychological distress in migrants and 
native citizens in long-term imprisonment. In addition, we investigated whether
any aspects of living conditions in prison reduce psychological distress.
Methods: From the 1,101 participants in the European Union (EU) project
"Long-term imprisonment and the issue of human rights in member states of the
EU," we chose 49 migrants, defined as people born in a different country from
where they were imprisoned, and 49 native citizens matched for prison, age (+/-5 
years), and index offense. The participants completed a questionnaire that
included the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and 128 items from a revised version
of the Mare-Balticum prison survey. Data were analyzed by multilevel regression
models. Results: Native citizens reported higher psychological distress than
migrants. However, multilevel regression analyses showed that poor relationships 
with fellow inmates and increased fear of crime were significant predictors of
increased psychological distress in migrants only. Conclusions: Being a migrant
by itself does not lead to increased psychological distress in prisoners. This
finding can be explained by the so-called healthy immigrant effect. However,
migrants experience psychological distress when prisons are not safe and when
they do not have close and trusting relationships with fellow inmates.

Speech disturbances are prevalent in psychosis. These may arise in part from
executive function impairment, as research suggests that inhibition and
monitoring are associated with production of cohesive discourse. However, it is
not yet understood how linguistic and executive function impairments in psychosis
interact with disrupted metacognition, or deficits in the ability to integrate
information to form a complex sense of oneself and others and use that synthesis 
to respond to psychosocial challenges. Whereas discourse studies have
historically employed manual hand-coding techniques, automated computational
tools can characterize deep semantic structures that may be closely linked with
metacognition. In the present study, we examined whether higher executive
functioning promotes metacognition by way of altering linguistic cohesion.
Ninety-four individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders provided illness
narratives and completed an executive function task battery (Delis-Kaplan
Executive Function System). We assessed the narratives for linguistic cohesion
(Coh-Metrix 3.0) and metacognitive capacity (Metacognition Assessment Scale -
Abbreviated). Selected linguistic indices measured the frequency of connections
between causal and intentional content (deep cohesion), word and theme overlap
(referential cohesion), and unique word usage (lexical diversity). In path
analyses using bootstrapped confidence intervals, we found that deep cohesion and
lexical diversity independently mediated the relationship between executive
functioning and metacognitive capacity. Findings suggest that executive control
abilities support integration of mental experiences by way of increasing causal, 
goal-driven speech and word expression in individuals with schizophrenia.
Metacognitive-based therapeutic interventions for psychosis may promote insight
and recovery in part by scaffolding use of language that links ideas together.

Mental health problems are common among students in higher education all over the
world, so identifying those who are at higher risk would allow the targeted
provision of help. Our goal was to develop an assessment tool to identify
students at risk for vulnerable mental health status. This tool was created from 
the 12-item General Health Questionnaire and Antonovsky's abbreviated sense of
coherence scale and was tested to distinguish between those with high or low
mental resilience. Predictive ability was characterized by likelihood ratios
taking the Beck Depression Inventory and perceived health as references.
One-quarter (95% CI 21.1% to 29.7%) of the students had been in vulnerable mental
health characterized by low sense of coherence and high distress, whereas 28.4%
(95% CI 24.2% to 33.1%) seemed resilient, having high sense of coherence and low 
distress. The high negative predictive value of the assessment tool reliably
identified resilient students in comparison with both the Beck Depression
Inventory (98.6%) and perceived health status (83.9%). Use of the assessment tool
is recommended for students to distinguish between those at decreased and
increased risk in terms of mental health. Mental health services should be
offered to students at higher risk.

PURPOSE: There is a dearth of research on coping strategies of patients with
malignant lymphoma. The aim of this article is to explore how these patients cope
with cancer in everyday life.
METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine patients in Sweden. A
thematic analysis was made, inspired by Antonovsky's theory of sense of
coherence. The SRQR checklist was used.
RESULTS: Patient's coping strategies are shown within three themes: 'Life
experiences supported coping strategies during treatment', 'Between completed
treatment and (possible) cure', and 'Illness brought closeness and distance in
social relationships'. Three different coping strategies were identified during
treatment: trying to control the situation, seeing opportunities in difficulties,
and doing other activities to limit thoughts about disease and treatment. Four
different coping strategies were identified after treatment ended, namely
projecting responsibility and anger onto the healthcare system, maintaining the
outer facade as a strong person who had control over the situation, talking about
disease, side effects and emotions and putting the focus on the future, and
managing life by anticipating death. Family =and friends were a part of patients'
coping strategies, but to different extents and in different ways. Diagnosis and 
treatment for malignant lymphoma brought closeness and distance in social
relationships.
CONCLUSION: Patients with malignant lymphoma cope with cancer in different ways
in everyday life influenced by their life experiences and life conditions.
Further research should focus on cancer patients' coping strategies in a
relational perspective, as coping and coping opportunities are embedded in social
context and social relationships.

OBJECTIVES: Practitioners and organizational leaders are calling for practical
ways to explain and monitor factors that affect workplace health and
productivity. This article builds on the well-established Job Demands-Resources
(JD-R) model and proposes an empirically tested ratio that aggregates indicators 
of job resources and demands. In this study, we calculate a ratio of
generalizable job resources and demands derived from the JD-R model and then
translate the ratio into the language of company stakeholders.
METHODS: We calculated a ratio based on measures applied in a large stress
management intervention study (n = 2983) and report the findings from
cross-sectional analysis with health and productivity outcomes from same-source
and separate-source data.
RESULTS: Findings showed a strong and unambiguous increase in health and
productivity measures with each step of increase in the ratio. Loss in explained 
variance due to aggregation of two factors into a single ratio is small for
measures which are known to be predicted by both factors simultaneously.
CONCLUSIONS: A translation and visualization of the ratio that is accessible to
practitioners and organizational leaders is presented and its use in companies
discussed.

Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumour in women around the world. The 
objective of this study was to quantify the number of non-haematological adverse 
reactions associated with chemotherapy, as well as to assess the effect of the
sense of coherence, optimism-pessimism and the quality of the doctor-patient
relationship on the quality of life of breast cancer patients. To this end, a
cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted involving 110 breast cancer
patients who were treated with docetaxel, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide during
the period 2012-2014. The difference in the quality of life in patients who have 
five or fewer toxicities compared to those with more than six is highlighted.
This difference is not as important when comparing patients with 6 to 10
toxicities and those with more than 10. The multivariate model used in this study
corroborates the direct implication of the sense of coherence on the quality of
life and adds the number of adverse reactions as a new construct. This has
virtually the same impact on the quality of life of these patients, but in
reverse. In conclusion, to improve the quality of life of breast cancer patients 
it would be necessary to have an impact on the number of adverse reactions
involved in chemotherapeutic treatment, as well as on psychological
interventions, with the sense of coherence as a possible starting point.

The clinical study of the cornea-contact lens relationship is widely used in the 
process of adaptation of the scleral contact lens (SCL) to the ocular morphology 
of patients. In that sense, the measurement of the adjustment between the SCL and
the cornea can be used to study the comfort or potential damage that the lens may
produce in the eye. The current analysis procedure implies the manual inspection 
of optical coherence tomography of the anterior segment images (AS-OCT) by the
clinical experts. This process presents several limitations such as the inability
to obtain complex metrics, the inaccuracies of the manual measurements or the
requirement of a time-consuming process by the expert in a tedious process, among
others. This work proposes a fully-automatic methodology for the extraction of
the areas of interest in the study of the cornea-contact lens relationship and
the measurement of representative metrics that allow the clinicians to measure
quantitatively the adjustment between the lens and the eye. In particular, three 
distance metrics are herein proposed: Vertical, normal to the tangent of the
region of interest and by the nearest point. Moreover, the images are classified 
to characterize the analysis as belonging to the central cornea, peripheral
cornea, limbus or sclera (regions where the inner layer of the lens has already
joined the cornea). Finally, the methodology graphically presents the results of 
the identified segmentations using an intuitive visualization that facilitates
the analysis and diagnosis of the patients by the clinical experts.
